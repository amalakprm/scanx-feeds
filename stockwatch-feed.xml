      <description><![CDATA[<strong>🔥 Trending</strong><br/><p>Vadilal Industries Ltd. announced the resignation of its independent director, Mr. Shivakumar Dega, due to the company&apos;s non-compliance with the Minimum Wages Act 1948 and Code of Wages 2019. Mr. Dega expressed his concerns in his resignation letter dated February 17, 2026, stating that the company has been paying its factory workers less than the minimum wage, which is a serious offence under Indian law. This violation has resulted in potential legal action for forced labour under Article 23 of the Indian Constitution. Despite raising the issue in several meetings and putting it down in writing, the board has not acted in the interests of all shareholders and the factory workers. The company is trying to stretch this liability over 2 to 4 years, which Mr. Dega strongly opposes. The board, however, seems unhappy with Mr. Dega for raising the minimum wage issue.</p><ul><li>Vadilal Industries independent director, Mr. Shivakumar Dega, resigns over non-compliance with Minimum Wages Act 1948 and Code of Wages 2019.</li><li>Company has been paying its factory workers less than the minimum wage, a serious offence under Indian law.</li><li>Potential legal action for forced labour under Article 23 of the Indian Constitution.</li><li>Despite raising the issue in several meetings, the board has not acted in the interests of all shareholders and the factory workers.</li><li>Company trying to stretch this liability over 2 to 4 years, which Mr. Dega strongly opposes.</li></ul><p>📄 <a href="https://www.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachLive/b0290b9a-88bf-421a-8657-a3a1ad0ffb5f.pdf">Read Official Filing (PDF)</a></p><br/><small>Company: VADILAL INDUSTRIES LTD.-$ | Category: Legal</small>]]></description>
