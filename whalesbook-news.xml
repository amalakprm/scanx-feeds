The favorable policy environment fueled 267 deals, an 18% increase, with major transactions including Deribit, Kraken's acquisition of NinjaTrader, and Ripple's significant purchase. Experts also cite a rush for licenses as financial institutions acquire firms to enter crypto markets amidst evolving global compliance rules like the EU's MiCA framework.
