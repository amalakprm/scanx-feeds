The Public Enterprises Survey for FY25 shows a 1.61% overall employment growth driven by over 54,000 new casual/contract hires, contrasting with a loss of around 30,000 regular employees. This shift is attributed to managing wage bills and reducing statutory payments. The share of women in the total CPSE workforce has also decreased.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 12:12:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://news-whales.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/images/thumbnail_694d2c72e10c98d07889537b_1766665518077.jpeg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine Drones Strike Russia's HUGE Gas Plant!

These approvals are unlikely to break the current duopoly of IndiGo and Air India anytime soon, as many aspiring airlines fail before commencing operations.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 11:46:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://news-whales.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/images/thumbnail_694d2634e10c98d078894e7b_1766663875398.jpeg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>IndiGo Chaos: 67 Flights Axed Amid Fog Drama, DGCA Watch Intensifies!</title><link>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Transportation/IndiGo-Chaos-67-Flights-Axed-Amid-Fog-Drama-DGCA-Watch-Intensifies/694d25cfe10c98d078894ddb</link><guid>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Transportation/IndiGo-Chaos-67-Flights-Axed-Amid-Fog-Drama-DGCA-Watch-Intensifies/694d25cfe10c98d078894ddb</guid><description>IndiGo cancelled 67 flights on Thursday due to forecasted fog and operational issues, adding to ongoing winter disruptions.
