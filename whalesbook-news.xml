This pivot aims to capture higher dine-in gross margins, estimated at 15-20% above delivery, driven by savings on aggregator commissions and reduced discounting. However, this shift occurs amidst intense competition from dominant delivery platforms, rising operational costs, and a consumer base increasingly swayed by digital convenience. Jubilant FoodWorks, Devyani International, Restaurant Brands Asia, and Speciality Restaurants are recalibrating their models, though the long-term success of recapturing footfall against ingrained delivery habits remains a significant question.</description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Feb 2026 00:53:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://images.whalesbook.com/images/thumbnail_69a23c8efa7d0695d1afc7ef_1772240148880.jpeg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>India's Sneaker Boom: Premium Valuations Mask Rising Risks</title><link>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Consumer-Products/Indias-Sneaker-Boom-Premium-Valuations-Mask-Rising-Risks/69a23c82fa7d0695d1afc7d6</link><guid>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Consumer-Products/Indias-Sneaker-Boom-Premium-Valuations-Mask-Rising-Risks/69a23c82fa7d0695d1afc7d6</guid><description>India's sneaker market is expanding rapidly, shifting focus to premiumization and aspirational consumption, projected to reach US$4.5 billion by 2030. While Metro Brands, Campus Activewear, and Bata India are executing diverse strategies to capture growth, elevated valuations and sensitivity to macroeconomic shifts pose significant risks. Investors must weigh sustained premium pricing against the potential for demand compression in a discretionary spending environment, alongside intense competitive pressures from global players.</description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Feb 2026 00:53:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://images.whalesbook.com/images/thumbnail_69a23c82fa7d0695d1afc7d5_1772240152000.jpeg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Indian Stocks Surge Amid Market Pressure on AI, ESG Catalysts</title><link>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Brokerage-Reports/Indian-Stocks-Surge-Amid-Market-Pressure-on-AI-ESG-Catalysts/69a23b9efa7d0695d1afc61a</link><guid>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Brokerage-Reports/Indian-Stocks-Surge-Amid-Market-Pressure-on-AI-ESG-Catalysts/69a23b9efa7d0695d1afc61a</guid><description>Amidst a challenging week for Indian equity markets, marked by declines in the Sensex and Nifty, several leading brokerage firms have identified select stocks with substantial upside potential. These recommendations are anchored by companies leveraging advanced manufacturing capabilities, artificial intelligence integration, and strong sector-specific growth drivers.

This strategic pivot, driven by cleaner fuel demand and policy support, has led to significant valuation differences among key players. Adani Total Gas commands a premium for its aggressive expansion, while Indraprastha Gas and Gujarat Gas offer stability. IRM Energy remains an early-stage play facing execution hurdles and lower returns. Investors face a choice between high-growth bets with execution risks and established, steadier performers.</description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Feb 2026 00:49:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://images.whalesbook.com/images/thumbnail_69a23b82fa7d0695d1afc5f1_1772240173876.jpeg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>India's Agri-Finance Gap: Public Dominance Risks Private Capital</title><link>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Agriculture/Indias-Agri-Finance-Gap-Public-Dominance-Risks-Private-Capital/69a23b6efa7d0695d1afc5ab</link><guid>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Agriculture/Indias-Agri-Finance-Gap-Public-Dominance-Risks-Private-Capital/69a23b6efa7d0695d1afc5ab</guid><description>India's agricultural sector is critically underfunded for climate adaptation, facing an annual gap estimated between $310-$365 billion by 2035. The agri-food system receives only 20% of required adaptation funds, with public finance dominating domestic efforts (98-99%). Private sector participation is minimal due to high investment risks, long gestation periods, and fragmented landholdings. Despite COP30 agreements to enhance domestic climate finance ecosystems through platforms like the Green Climate Fund, unlocking private capital remains a challenge.</description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Feb 2026 00:48:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://images.whalesbook.com/images/thumbnail_69a23b6efa7d0695d1afc5aa_1772239985680.jpeg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>India's Capital Account Strain: Valuations, Outflows Cloud Outlook</title><link>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Economy/Indias-Capital-Account-Strain-Valuations-Outflows-Cloud-Outlook/69a23b18fa7d0695d1afc51b</link><guid>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Economy/Indias-Capital-Account-Strain-Valuations-Outflows-Cloud-Outlook/69a23b18fa7d0695d1afc51b</guid><description>India's capital account is under significant strain, characterized by substantial Foreign Portfolio Investor (FPI) outflows and declining net Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). Despite recent RBI liberalization of External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs), the currency faces ongoing depreciation pressure. Elevated domestic market valuations, coupled with a competitive global investment landscape favoring developed economies, are key factors contributing to investor caution. Analysts anticipate continued volatility throughout 2026.</description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Feb 2026 00:47:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://images.whalesbook.com/images/thumbnail_69a23b18fa7d0695d1afc51a_1772239966915.jpeg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>India EV 2W: Powering Livelihoods &amp; Indigenous Industry</title><link>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Industrial-Goods-Services/India-EV-2W-Powering-Livelihoods-and-Indigenous-Industry/69a23b0dfa7d0695d1afc4ff</link><guid>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Industrial-Goods-Services/India-EV-2W-Powering-Livelihoods-and-Indigenous-Industry/69a23b0dfa7d0695d1afc4ff</guid><description>The Indian electric two-wheeler market is rapidly evolving from basic transport to critical economic assets. These vehicles are electrifying livelihoods, creating employment, and addressing urban challenges while simultaneously driving domestic industrialization. Despite past safety concerns and import reliance, the sector's growth is underpinned by strong government policy, innovation in battery technology, and a growing demand for sustainable, affordable mobility solutions.

This move significantly impacts Indian solar exporters, with key companies like Waaree Energies and Premier Energies experiencing sharp stock declines. While Union Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal stated the duties are outside the India-US trade deal and the situation is fluid, the action raises questions about bilateral trade relations and India's strategic export ambitions. The duties are expected to make US market access economically unviable for Indian manufacturers, potentially leading to domestic oversupply and necessitating a recalibration of export strategies. Despite these headwinds, India's long-term solar sector outlook remains robust, supported by strong domestic demand and government policies.</description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Feb 2026 00:15:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://images.whalesbook.com/images/thumbnail_69a23392fa7d0695d1afc26f_1772237835249.jpeg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>R Systems Board Meeting March 6 to Consider Interim Dividend</title><link>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Tech/R-Systems-Board-Meeting-March-6-to-Consider-Interim-Dividend/69a23133fa7d0695d1afc13a</link><guid>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Tech/R-Systems-Board-Meeting-March-6-to-Consider-Interim-Dividend/69a23133fa7d0695d1afc13a</guid><description>R Systems International Limited has scheduled a Board Meeting for March 6, 2026, to deliberate on declaring an interim dividend.
