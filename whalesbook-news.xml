This decision follows heightened geopolitical tensions after U.S./Israeli strikes on Iran and subsequent retaliatory actions. However, analysts widely view the output adjustment as insufficient to counter the severe supply disruption risks posed by potential blockades of critical shipping routes like the Strait of Hormuz, suggesting market volatility will remain dictated by conflict developments rather than increased supply.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Mar 2026 17:51:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://images.whalesbook.com/images/thumbnail_69a47c913d2913aa7c214525_1772387605742.jpeg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Middle East Tensions Spark Trade Crisis, India Eyes Mitigation</title><link>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Transportation/Middle-East-Tensions-Spark-Trade-Crisis-India-Eyes-Mitigation/69a47b9d3d2913aa7c214408</link><guid>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Transportation/Middle-East-Tensions-Spark-Trade-Crisis-India-Eyes-Mitigation/69a47b9d3d2913aa7c214408</guid><description>An urgent meeting is scheduled for Monday with Indian exporters and shipping representatives to address disruptions stemming from Middle East geopolitical tensions.

A geopolitical risk premium of $4-$10 per barrel is being factored into prices. However, analysts caution that elevated oil prices are unlikely to persist, as global debt-to-GDP ratios near 95% magnify the economic damage of any energy shock. Upstream energy firms may see short-term gains, while dependent sectors face pressure.

This month-on-month moderation is attributed to February's shorter duration. However, daily transaction averages increased to 728 million, with values reaching Rs 95,865 crore, underscoring UPI's maturation into essential financial infrastructure. Other digital payment systems like IMPS, FASTag, and AePS also experienced monthly declines, though some showed increased daily activity, reflecting a broader trend of scaling and optimization within India's digital payment ecosystem. Annual growth for UPI remained robust, up 27% in volume and 22% in value compared to the prior year.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Mar 2026 11:37:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://images.whalesbook.com/images/thumbnail_69a425013d2913aa7c212280_1772365151895.jpeg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Mercedes V-Class Reimagined: India's Luxury MPV Race Heats Up</title><link>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Auto/Mercedes-V-Class-Reimagined-Indias-Luxury-MPV-Race-Heats-Up/69a423033d2913aa7c21218c</link><guid>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Auto/Mercedes-V-Class-Reimagined-Indias-Luxury-MPV-Race-Heats-Up/69a423033d2913aa7c21218c</guid><description>Mercedes-Benz is reintroducing its V-Class in India, repositioning it as an ultra-luxury, chauffeur-focused flagship with a price tag exceeding ₹1.5 crore.
