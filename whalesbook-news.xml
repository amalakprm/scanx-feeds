This strategic move follows a recent 13% decline in the stock over six months, and places its current P/E ratio of approximately 33.3x at a premium compared to its historical average and key competitor Adani Ports. Despite concerns over potential dilution and a revised FY26 volume growth forecast, a majority of analysts maintain a 'Buy' rating, citing robust long-term growth prospects driven by sector tailwinds.</description><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 04:21:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://images.whalesbook.com/images/headline-6993ecb6cffb93b3e92795e5.jpg.jpeg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Fortis Healthcare: Analyst Optimism Meets Stretched Valuation</title><link>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Healthcare-Biotech/Fortis-Healthcare-Analyst-Optimism-Meets-Stretched-Valuation/6993ecb2cffb93b3e92795cf</link><guid>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Healthcare-Biotech/Fortis-Healthcare-Analyst-Optimism-Meets-Stretched-Valuation/6993ecb2cffb93b3e92795cf</guid><description>Fortis Healthcare's stock saw an upward tick as brokerages like UBS, Citi, and JPMorgan issued 'buy' or 'overweight' ratings, citing robust Q3 revenue growth of 17.5% and strong EBITDA performance. However, a deeper analysis reveals a significant 21.9% year-on-year net profit decline for the quarter ending December 31, 2025, alongside a P/E ratio now categorized as 'very expensive'. Parent company IHH Healthcare's increasing stake and expansion plans form a key strategic pillar, but investors are factoring in substantial growth at a premium.</description><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 04:21:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://images.whalesbook.com/images/headline-6993ecb2cffb93b3e92795ce.jpg.jpeg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ola Electric Stock Crumbles Amidst Citi Downgrade and Deepening Financial Woes</title><link>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Auto/Ola-Electric-Stock-Crumbles-Amidst-Citi-Downgrade-and-Deepening-Financial-Woes/6993ecb1cffb93b3e92795b8</link><guid>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Auto/Ola-Electric-Stock-Crumbles-Amidst-Citi-Downgrade-and-Deepening-Financial-Woes/6993ecb1cffb93b3e92795b8</guid><description>Ola Electric Mobility's stock opened lower Tuesday, extending a multi-session decline, following a sharp downgrade by Citigroup. Citi analysts moved their rating to 'Sell' and slashed the price target by over 50%, citing concerns over slower-than-expected electric vehicle penetration in India's two-wheeler segment and market share erosion. The downgrade underscores significant financial pressures, including negative free cash flow and mounting debt, contrasting with a burgeoning overall EV market.</description><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 04:21:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://images.whalesbook.com/images/thumbnail_6993ecb1cffb93b3e92795b7_1771302195519.jpeg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Hazoor Multi Projects Secures ₹44 Crore NHAI Toll Contract in Karnataka</title><link>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Transportation/Hazoor-Multi-Projects-Secures-44-Crore-NHAI-Toll-Contract-in-Karnataka/6993ebc0cffb93b3e9279499</link><guid>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Transportation/Hazoor-Multi-Projects-Secures-44-Crore-NHAI-Toll-Contract-in-Karnataka/6993ebc0cffb93b3e9279499</guid><description>Hazoor Multi Projects Limited has secured a significant Letter of Award (LOA) from the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) for user fee collection and maintenance services at the Balenahalli fee plaza in Karnataka.

The market faces a dual challenge: persistent foreign institutional investor (FII) selling pressure and escalating geopolitical tensions, particularly concerning Iran. While domestic institutional investors (DIIs) continue to provide a crucial buffer, the sustainability of recent sectoral gains is in question. Global markets are subdued, with mixed Asian trading and a firm US dollar adding to the cautious sentiment. Oil prices have risen due to heightened geopolitical risks, while gold has seen a decline.</description><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 02:07:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://images.whalesbook.com/images/thumbnail_6993cd52cffb93b3e9276cb3_1771294149309.jpeg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Gaudium IVF IPO: Valuation Risks Shadowing Expansion Ambitions</title><link>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Healthcare-Biotech/Gaudium-IVF-IPO-Valuation-Risks-Shadowing-Expansion-Ambitions/6993cb6dcffb93b3e9276ba9</link><guid>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Healthcare-Biotech/Gaudium-IVF-IPO-Valuation-Risks-Shadowing-Expansion-Ambitions/6993cb6dcffb93b3e9276ba9</guid><description>Gaudium IVF &amp; Women Health is set to debut on the stock markets with a Rs 165 crore Initial Public Offering (IPO), pricing itself at Rs 575 crore.

Initiatives aim to boost productivity, farmer incomes, and value-added processing, leveraging schemes like the Coconut Promotion Scheme and Mahila Coir Yojana. However, the sector faces a formidable challenge in translating domestic strengths into global competitiveness, with established players like the Philippines and Indonesia dominating export markets for value-added products.

This move aligns with Reserve Bank of India (RBI) directives mandating advanced, dynamic authentication factors. Initial consumer uptake shows 30% opting for passkeys, signaling a shift towards faster, more secure payments and an expected 2-3% increase in transaction success rates. The initiative aims to combat rising card fraud, estimated at over ₹1,800 crore between FY22 and September 2025, particularly social engineering scams exploiting OTP vulnerabilities. While banks avoid major API changes, policy adjustments are key. This transition marks a significant step in India's rapidly growing digital payments market, projected for substantial growth through 2034, as the nation embraces a digitally-first payment culture.</description><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 00:45:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://images.whalesbook.com/images/thumbnail_6993ba14cffb93b3e9276477_1771289238715.jpeg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>India's 5th-Gen AMCA Fighter: DRDO Shortlists New Defense Powerhouses</title><link>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Industrial-Goods-Services/Indias-5th-Gen-AMCA-Fighter-DRDO-Shortlists-New-Defense-Powerhouses/6993b167cffb93b3e927620b</link><guid>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Industrial-Goods-Services/Indias-5th-Gen-AMCA-Fighter-DRDO-Shortlists-New-Defense-Powerhouses/6993b167cffb93b3e927620b</guid><description>The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) has shortlisted three key entities for the development of India's Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA).

The deal is partly conditioned on India halting Russian oil purchases.
