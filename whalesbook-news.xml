This trend, driven by a post-pandemic structural shift in savings behavior, signals a growing preference for managed investments over direct stock picking. While overall household equity wealth has surged, the declining share of direct individual ownership to multi-year lows highlights a significant divergence in retail participation strategies. This pivot is supported by favorable macro-economic conditions and digital access, though risks associated with fund concentration and investor maturity persist.</description><pubDate>Sun, 22 Feb 2026 17:57:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://images.whalesbook.com/images/thumbnail_699b4378ee97f501b0ea524d_1771783236932.jpeg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Gold &amp; Silver ETFs Surge Past Equities: Investor Flight to Safety</title><link>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Commodities/Gold-and-Silver-ETFs-Surge-Past-Equities-Investor-Flight-to-Safety/699b4376ee97f501b0ea5237</link><guid>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Commodities/Gold-and-Silver-ETFs-Surge-Past-Equities-Investor-Flight-to-Safety/699b4376ee97f501b0ea5237</guid><description>January 2026 witnessed a dramatic surge in Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) inflows into gold and silver Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) and Fund of Funds (FoFs), totaling ₹1,441 crore, a fourfold increase from the previous year.

While this eases pressure on key export sectors and strengthens India's negotiating hand, the US administration's rapid pivot to alternative legal mechanisms, like Section 122 tariffs, indicates trade policy remains volatile. This shift from sweeping levies to more targeted, albeit temporary, measures creates a complex and uncertain trade environment, suggesting the US retains significant leverage despite the judicial setback.
