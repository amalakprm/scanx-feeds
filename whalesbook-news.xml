While positioning the nation as a global investment hub, this strategy faces scrutiny over the sustainability of direct tax reliance amid global economic uncertainties and potentially stretched market valuations.

While firms report significant productivity gains and CEOs are optimistic about AI's ROI, the true impact hinges on AI's real-world productivity and integration challenges.

This national push aims to reduce import dependence and foster domestic capacity in electrolyser manufacturing, creating opportunities across infrastructure, power, refining, and fertilizer sectors. While capital commitments are rising and pilot projects are commencing, the sector remains nascent. Investors face a landscape where core businesses still drive current earnings, and long-term green hydrogen economics hinge on future cost competitiveness and large-scale execution. Companies like L&amp;T, NTPC, JSW Energy, IOC, and GSFC represent diverse entry points into this evolving ecosystem, but significant hurdles persist before hydrogen becomes a primary profit center.</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2026 02:14:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://images.whalesbook.com/images/headline-698fda6f7e6478cdfc2744cc.jpg.jpeg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Honasa Consumer Recovers on Strong Q3, But Valuation Concerns Linger</title><link>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Consumer-Products/Honasa-Consumer-Recovers-on-Strong-Q3-But-Valuation-Concerns-Linger/698fc8287e6478cdfc274271</link><guid>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Consumer-Products/Honasa-Consumer-Recovers-on-Strong-Q3-But-Valuation-Concerns-Linger/698fc8287e6478cdfc274271</guid><description>Honasa Consumer, parent of Mamaearth, reported its highest-ever quarterly revenue of ₹601.5 crore and a 93% surge in net profit to ₹50.2 crore for Q3 FY26. This turnaround follows significant operational challenges including a ₹65 crore inventory write-off and negative margins in Q2 FY25 due to a costly distribution restructuring.
