Pang led AI infrastructure at Meta's Superintelligence Labs. This move intensifies the AI talent war, with top researchers commanding packages reportedly exceeding $200 million. The aggressive recruitment by OpenAI and other tech giants raises questions about the financial sustainability of such high compensation and the strategic implications for companies like Meta and Apple, which are losing critical AI expertise.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 15:38:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://images.whalesbook.com/images/thumbnail_69a069059e91847a1e78fcaf_1772120604956.jpeg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Merlin Group Bets Big on Pune with ₹273 Cr Mundhwa Land Deal</title><link>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Real-Estate/Merlin-Group-Bets-Big-on-Pune-with-273-Cr-Mundhwa-Land-Deal/69a068299e91847a1e78fbae</link><guid>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Real-Estate/Merlin-Group-Bets-Big-on-Pune-with-273-Cr-Mundhwa-Land-Deal/69a068299e91847a1e78fbae</guid><description>Kolkata-based Merlin Group has acquired a 3.26-acre land parcel in Pune's Mundhwa locality for ₹273 crore through its subsidiary, Merlin Prime Spaces.

However, a significant downward revision to 2024-2025 payroll figures, slashing job creation by hundreds of thousands to just 181,000 last year, points to a structural deceleration in the U.S. labor market. This trend, coupled with job openings falling to a five-year low, reinforces an economic environment characterized by a "low-hire, low-fire" dynamic, where finding new employment is increasingly challenging despite low unemployment rates. Lingering effects from high interest rates and trade uncertainties continue to hamper hiring momentum.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 15:11:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://images.whalesbook.com/images/thumbnail_69a062909e91847a1e78f391_1772118794188.jpeg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>iValue Infosolutions to Host Investor Call on AI Impact March 4</title><link>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Tech/iValue-Infosolutions-to-Host-Investor-Call-on-AI-Impact-March-4/69a0628a9e91847a1e78f37b</link><guid>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Tech/iValue-Infosolutions-to-Host-Investor-Call-on-AI-Impact-March-4/69a0628a9e91847a1e78f37b</guid><description>iValue Infosolutions Limited announced it will host a virtual business update call for investors on March 4, 2026.
