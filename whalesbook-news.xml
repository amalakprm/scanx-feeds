This shift moves the market from startup-led disruption to incumbent dominance driven by scale and distribution networks. While TVS and Bajaj have leveraged their strengths for significant sales growth, startups like Ola Electric are facing severe market share erosion and execution challenges, contrasted by Ather Energy's strategic product positioning and steady growth. The evolving consumer priorities now favor reliability and after-sales support, reshaping the competitive dynamics.</description><pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2026 00:47:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://images.whalesbook.com/images/thumbnail_6991178b12665ef560f98c78_1771116608519.jpeg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>India's Digital Surge: From Data Costs to 6G Ambitions</title><link>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Economy/Indias-Digital-Surge-From-Data-Costs-to-6G-Ambitions/699111ee12665ef560f989de</link><guid>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Economy/Indias-Digital-Surge-From-Data-Costs-to-6G-Ambitions/699111ee12665ef560f989de</guid><description>India's economic momentum is propelled by a robust digital highway. Broadband subscribers have surpassed 970 million, fueled by data costs plummeting to approximately ₹9 per GB, democratizing access nationwide. The nation now leads global digital transactions, with UPI processing immense volumes. A strategic shift towards indigenous telecom technology, including BSNL's 4G network and ambitious 6G goals, aims for global standardization and patent leadership.</description><pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2026 00:23:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://images.whalesbook.com/images/thumbnail_699111ee12665ef560f989dd_1771115169736.jpeg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Copper Stocks Correct Amidst Inventory Glut, Demand Slowdown</title><link>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Industrial-Goods-Services/Copper-Stocks-Correct-Amidst-Inventory-Glut-Demand-Slowdown/6991117612665ef560f988fa</link><guid>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Industrial-Goods-Services/Copper-Stocks-Correct-Amidst-Inventory-Glut-Demand-Slowdown/6991117612665ef560f988fa</guid><description>Copper's narrative of impending scarcity and price rallies is fraying at the edges. While long-term demand drivers like AI and electrification remain robust, recent weeks have seen significant copper stock corrections for key Indian players like Hindustan Copper and Hindalco Industries. This divergence from the bullish macro outlook stems from a confluence of factors: surging global inventories, particularly in the U.S., a more pronounced demand slowdown in China than anticipated, and evolving smelter economics. For investors, the current market disconnect presents a complex picture, moving beyond simple supply-demand equations to consider specific company challenges and escalating geopolitical trade implications.</description><pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2026 00:21:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://images.whalesbook.com/images/thumbnail_6991117612665ef560f988f9_1771115046588.jpeg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Restaurant Brands Asia: Scale Emerging, But Profitability Path Uncertain</title><link>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Consumer-Products/Restaurant-Brands-Asia-Scale-Emerging-But-Profitability-Path-Uncertain/6991117112665ef560f988e3</link><guid>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Consumer-Products/Restaurant-Brands-Asia-Scale-Emerging-But-Profitability-Path-Uncertain/6991117112665ef560f988e3</guid><description>Restaurant Brands Asia (RBA) posted a 16.5% revenue increase to ₹5,773 million in Q3 FY26, fueled by 577 stores and 4.5% same-store sales growth. Gross margins improved to 69.9%, and EBITDA margins expanded, indicating early operational leverage. However, net losses persist, the Indonesian segment remains a significant drag, and the company carries a high debt-to-equity ratio. A recent strategic shift sees Inspira Global acquiring a controlling stake, injecting capital and aiming for value creation.</description><pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2026 00:21:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://images.whalesbook.com/images/thumbnail_6991117112665ef560f988e2_1771115127345.jpeg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Domestic Institutions Lead as Investors Favor Growth Over Profitability</title><link>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Stock-Investment-Ideas/Domestic-Institutions-Lead-as-Investors-Favor-Growth-Over-Profitability/699110fb12665ef560f98886</link><guid>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Stock-Investment-Ideas/Domestic-Institutions-Lead-as-Investors-Favor-Growth-Over-Profitability/699110fb12665ef560f98886</guid><description>Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) have overtaken Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) in Nifty 50 equity stakes, injecting significant capital into the market in 2025. Despite a broader market downturn in February 2026, particularly impacting IT stocks due to AI disruption fears, DIIs and FIIs converged on five key stocks. This includes banking and IT players like Mphasis and RBL Bank, exhibiting strong growth and strategic initiatives, but also Utkarsh Small Finance Bank and Swiggy, which currently report widening losses and asset quality concerns. Institutional conviction appears increasingly focused on long-term strategic growth narratives rather than immediate profitability.</description><pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2026 00:19:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://images.whalesbook.com/images/thumbnail_699110fb12665ef560f98885_1771115009100.jpeg" type="image/jpeg" /></item></channel></rss>
