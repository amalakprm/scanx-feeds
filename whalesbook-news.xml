RBC will tie capital requirements directly to an insurer's risk profile, moving away from uniform solvency thresholds. Ind AS 117 will change revenue and profit recognition, recognizing them over the policy term instead of upfront. These changes aim to bring greater discipline to pricing, reserving, and overall business strategy, potentially impacting product attractiveness and requiring weaker companies to seek capital or consolidate.
