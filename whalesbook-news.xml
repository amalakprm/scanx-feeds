The deal, valued at ₹364.80 crore, involves a 63:37 revenue share between the developer and landowners. This partnership structure reduces upfront land acquisition costs, allowing Macrotech to enhance its development pipeline in a prime micro-market known for its transformation into a residential hub. The move aligns with a broader trend of developers favoring such agreements in high-cost urban environments to preserve capital and optimize project viability, especially amidst limited availability of large land parcels.</description><pubDate>Sun, 22 Feb 2026 12:23:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://images.whalesbook.com/images/thumbnail_699af526ee97f501b0ea3496_1771763150984.jpeg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Adani Power Fuels East India Push with ₹40,000 Cr Power Projects</title><link>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Industrial-Goods-Services/Adani-Power-Fuels-East-India-Push-with-40000-Cr-Power-Projects/699af43aee97f501b0ea340e</link><guid>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Industrial-Goods-Services/Adani-Power-Fuels-East-India-Push-with-40000-Cr-Power-Projects/699af43aee97f501b0ea340e</guid><description>Adani Group Chairman Gautam Adani reviewed over ₹40,000 crore in power investments across Jharkhand and Bihar, focusing on the 1,600 MW Godda plant exporting power to Bangladesh and a new 2,400 MW project in Bihar. These initiatives cement Adani's infrastructure presence in historically capital-scarce eastern regions, alongside Adani Power's market capitalization of approximately ₹2.75 lakh crore and a P/E ratio around 24x.

While this eases pressure on key export sectors and strengthens India's negotiating hand, the US administration's rapid pivot to alternative legal mechanisms, like Section 122 tariffs, indicates trade policy remains volatile. This shift from sweeping levies to more targeted, albeit temporary, measures creates a complex and uncertain trade environment, suggesting the US retains significant leverage despite the judicial setback. The market reaction has been positive, anticipating an improvement in export competitiveness and capital inflows, though long-term stability hinges on the legal viability and duration of these new measures.</description><pubDate>Sun, 22 Feb 2026 11:57:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://images.whalesbook.com/images/thumbnail_699aef22ee97f501b0ea322d_1771761562574.jpeg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>NCR Rapid Rail Expands: New Corridors Planned Amidst TOD Push</title><link>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Transportation/NCR-Rapid-Rail-Expands-New-Corridors-Planned-Amidst-TOD-Push/699ae6bfee97f501b0ea2f1f</link><guid>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Transportation/NCR-Rapid-Rail-Expands-New-Corridors-Planned-Amidst-TOD-Push/699ae6bfee97f501b0ea2f1f</guid><description>Union Housing and Urban Affairs Minister Manohar Lal Khattar revealed plans for two new rapid rail corridors originating from Sarai Kale Khan, aimed at bolstering the National Capital Region's (NCR) high-speed transit network. This expansion is intrinsically linked to a broader strategy of transit-oriented development (TOD) designed to decentralize economic activity and alleviate pressure on Delhi.

This strategic move is supported by favorable central government policies relaxing minimum import prices for key antibiotics, which the company views as a crucial catalyst for domestic self-reliance. Concurrently, Aurobindo is progressing with its China and US facility expansions, anticipating EBITDA breakeven in China this quarter and revenue contributions from its US operations starting fiscal year 2027. The company maintains confidence in its growth trajectory, targeting higher end of 20-21% EBITDA margins for FY26.</description><pubDate>Sun, 22 Feb 2026 07:07:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://images.whalesbook.com/images/thumbnail_699aab1f73bcaafe2ac128cb_1771744151156.jpeg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>India-US Trade Talks Postponed: A Strategic Pause Amidst Tariff Chaos</title><link>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/World-Affairs/India-US-Trade-Talks-Postponed-A-Strategic-Pause-Amidst-Tariff-Chaos/699aa9b873bcaafe2ac127cf</link><guid>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/World-Affairs/India-US-Trade-Talks-Postponed-A-Strategic-Pause-Amidst-Tariff-Chaos/699aa9b873bcaafe2ac127cf</guid><description>India and the United States have postponed key trade negotiations meant to finalize an interim bilateral agreement. This deferral signals India's strategic intent to reassess terms amidst evolving U.S. trade policy following a Supreme Court ruling that invalidated broad tariffs. While public statements suggest talks remain on track, the postponement likely reflects India's effort to leverage the new tariff landscape, where a uniform U.S. global tariff replaces previously negotiated rates, potentially diminishing the value of India's concessions and offering leverage for renegotiation.</description><pubDate>Sun, 22 Feb 2026 07:01:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://images.whalesbook.com/images/thumbnail_699aa9b873bcaafe2ac127ce_1771743812412.jpeg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>India-US Trade Talks Stall Amid Tariff Policy Chaos</title><link>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/International-News/India-US-Trade-Talks-Stall-Amid-Tariff-Policy-Chaos/699aa8c573bcaafe2ac1271d</link><guid>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/International-News/India-US-Trade-Talks-Stall-Amid-Tariff-Policy-Chaos/699aa8c573bcaafe2ac1271d</guid><description>The chief negotiators' meeting for the India-US interim trade pact has been rescheduled.

A strong recovery in power demand during December and January, driven by a harsh winter and economic uptick, offers a short-term reprieve after a period of demand slowdown. However, this comes after the industry hit a record one-billion-tonne production milestone, creating an environment of strategic uncertainty.

This deceleration stems from a significant 23.4% contraction in government capital expenditure and slower expansion in services and agriculture. While the industrial sector shows resilience with an 8.3% growth projection, it's insufficient to offset broader slowdowns. Weak merchandise exports and moderating services exports also contribute to the headwinds, though robust domestic demand, buoyed by GST rationalization, is expected to maintain growth above the 7% mark.</description><pubDate>Sun, 22 Feb 2026 06:00:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://images.whalesbook.com/images/thumbnail_699a9b6781427192210207fe_1771740136785.jpeg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>ICICI Bank Faces ₹50.38 Cr GST Demand On Appeal; Contests Order</title><link>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Banking-Finance/ICICI-Bank-Faces-5038-Cr-GST-Demand-On-Appeal-Contests-Order/699a981f81427192210206e6</link><guid>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Banking-Finance/ICICI-Bank-Faces-5038-Cr-GST-Demand-On-Appeal-Contests-Order/699a981f81427192210206e6</guid><description>ICICI Bank has received an Order in Appeal from the Maharashtra GST Department, confirming a tax demand of ₹50.38 crore, plus penalty and interest.
