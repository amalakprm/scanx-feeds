While the policy aims to lower costs for distributors and consumers, and boost revenue for producers, achieving ambitious blending targets hinges on significant infrastructure build-out, consistent feedstock supply, and navigating potential competition from other green energy initiatives. The waiver addresses a key pricing imbalance, making renewable biogas more cost-competitive, which is crucial for project IRR improvements and attracting previously marginal financing.</description><pubDate>Sun, 22 Feb 2026 09:15:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://images.whalesbook.com/images/thumbnail_699ac91bee97f501b0ea2187_1771751855907.jpeg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>India Growth Race: Mondelez, Reckitt Navigate Complex Execution</title><link>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Consumer-Products/India-Growth-Race-Mondelez-Reckitt-Navigate-Complex-Execution/699ac845ee97f501b0ea20b0</link><guid>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Consumer-Products/India-Growth-Race-Mondelez-Reckitt-Navigate-Complex-Execution/699ac845ee97f501b0ea20b0</guid><description>Global consumer giants Mondelez International and Reckitt are intensifying their focus on India, a market poised for significant long-term growth driven by a rising middle class and increased disposable incomes.

Middle Eastern producers, particularly Saudi Arabia, are stepping in to fill the void, marking a shift from Russia's dominant post-Ukraine war position. This transition is projected to increase India's average crude acquisition costs by $2-$3 per barrel, as the nation navigates geopolitical alignment with energy security demands and supply chain complexities.

This deferral signals India's strategic intent to reassess terms amidst evolving U.S. trade policy following a Supreme Court ruling that invalidated broad tariffs.

This deceleration stems from a significant 23.4% contraction in government capital expenditure and slower expansion in services and agriculture. While the industrial sector shows resilience with an 8.3% growth projection, it's insufficient to offset broader slowdowns. Weak merchandise exports and moderating services exports also contribute to the headwinds, though robust domestic demand, buoyed by GST rationalization, is expected to maintain growth above the 7% mark.</description><pubDate>Sun, 22 Feb 2026 06:00:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://images.whalesbook.com/images/thumbnail_699a9b6781427192210207fe_1771740136785.jpeg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>ICICI Bank Faces ₹50.38 Cr GST Demand On Appeal; Contests Order</title><link>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Banking-Finance/ICICI-Bank-Faces-5038-Cr-GST-Demand-On-Appeal-Contests-Order/699a981f81427192210206e6</link><guid>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Banking-Finance/ICICI-Bank-Faces-5038-Cr-GST-Demand-On-Appeal-Contests-Order/699a981f81427192210206e6</guid><description>ICICI Bank has received an Order in Appeal from the Maharashtra GST Department, confirming a tax demand of ₹50.38 crore, plus penalty and interest.

Concurrently, India is witnessing significant growth in Swiss watch exports, rising over 35.5% in the first ten months of 2025, indicating a local expansion amidst a global correction. This divergence highlights a market bifurcation favoring assets with enduring cultural or technical value over those inflated by hype. Major luxury conglomerates like LVMH and Richemont reported revenue declines in 2025, reflecting the broader global trend, though both demonstrated resilience in profitability and cash flow. Swiss watch exports overall saw a 1.7% decrease in value for 2025, contrasting sharply with India's specific market surge.</description><pubDate>Sun, 22 Feb 2026 03:25:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://images.whalesbook.com/images/thumbnail_699a7712814271922101fd33_1771730891509.jpeg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>India's Drone Firms: Valuation vs. Reality Amidst Defence Boom</title><link>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Aerospace-&amp;-Defense/Indias-Drone-Firms-Valuation-vs-Reality-Amidst-Defence-Boom/699a6725814271922101f9b2</link><guid>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Aerospace-&amp;-Defense/Indias-Drone-Firms-Valuation-vs-Reality-Amidst-Defence-Boom/699a6725814271922101f9b2</guid><description>India's burgeoning drone sector sees Paras Defence and Space Technologies and Zen Technologies report strong Q3 FY26 results driven by defence orders.
