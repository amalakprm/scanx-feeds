The dollar-denominated offering on NSE IX and India INX represents a critical test for GIFT City's ambition to become a significant offshore capital-raising platform. Funds will fuel global expansion, but XED faces stiff competition and a modest raise size for its stated growth plans.</description><pubDate>Fri, 27 Feb 2026 21:01:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://images.whalesbook.com/images/thumbnail_69a20615fa7d0695d1afb5c3_1772226380360.jpeg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>India's Micro-Markets Surge, Forcing Retail Strategy Overhaul</title><link>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Economy/Indias-Micro-Markets-Surge-Forcing-Retail-Strategy-Overhaul/69a1f724fa7d0695d1afb168</link><guid>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Economy/Indias-Micro-Markets-Surge-Forcing-Retail-Strategy-Overhaul/69a1f724fa7d0695d1afb168</guid><description>India's semi-rural Tier 3-5 markets are outpacing metros in retail spending growth for 2025, a significant shift from previous years.

WBD's market capitalization stands around $70 billion with a P/E of approximately 153, while Netflix boasts a $350 billion market cap and a P/E around 31. Paramount Global's market cap is significantly lower, around $7-18 billion depending on share class.</description><pubDate>Fri, 27 Feb 2026 19:23:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://images.whalesbook.com/images/thumbnail_69a1ef19fa7d0695d1afadaf_1772220497429.jpeg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>India's Fibre Scheme: Ambitious Targets, Execution Hurdles</title><link>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Textile/Indias-Fibre-Scheme-Ambitious-Targets-Execution-Hurdles/69a1eb89fa7d0695d1afac0c</link><guid>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Textile/Indias-Fibre-Scheme-Ambitious-Targets-Execution-Hurdles/69a1eb89fa7d0695d1afac0c</guid><description>India's National Fibre Scheme, unveiled in the FY27 budget, aims for a 50% surge in fibre production and a 22% cut in imports by FY31.
