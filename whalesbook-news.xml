This figure, up from ₹1.69 lakh crore in February 2025, signals continued economic activity. Sequential collections also rose from ₹1.71 lakh crore in January 2026. Year-to-date gross collections stand at ₹20.27 lakh crore, an 8.3% rise. However, scrutiny of this nominal growth is warranted given prevailing inflation trends and regional fiscal divergences.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Mar 2026 10:21:54 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://images.whalesbook.com/images/thumbnail_69a41342edbd0c0ef019732f_1772360710394.jpeg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Loan Moratoriums: Strategic Tool vs. Costly Pause</title><link>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Personal-Finance/Loan-Moratoriums-Strategic-Tool-vs-Costly-Pause/69a40eddedbd0c0ef0197099</link><guid>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Personal-Finance/Loan-Moratoriums-Strategic-Tool-vs-Costly-Pause/69a40eddedbd0c0ef0197099</guid><description>Loan moratoriums, while offering immediate cash flow relief, carry significant long-term costs due to accruing interest. Financial institutions utilize them as a strategic risk management tool to prevent defaults and maintain borrower relationships. However, for borrowers, misjudging the temporary nature of income disruptions against structural issues can lead to a magnified repayment burden. Prudent application, clear communication with lenders on credit reporting, and a thorough assessment of revised amortization schedules are paramount.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Mar 2026 10:03:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://images.whalesbook.com/images/thumbnail_69a40eddedbd0c0ef0197098_1772359813714.jpeg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Geopolitical Tensions Drive Travel Insurance Demand</title><link>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Insurance/Geopolitical-Tensions-Drive-Travel-Insurance-Demand/69a40ed9edbd0c0ef0197082</link><guid>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Insurance/Geopolitical-Tensions-Drive-Travel-Insurance-Demand/69a40ed9edbd0c0ef0197082</guid><description>Escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East have triggered widespread flight cancellations and airspace closures, leading to a significant surge in demand for travel insurance. Indian insurers, including ICICI Lombard and TATA AIG, are experiencing heightened inquiries and policy purchases as travelers seek protection against trip disruptions, delays, and cancellations. This trend highlights the growing importance of comprehensive travel insurance in an increasingly volatile global environment. The situation has prompted airlines to reroute flights and offer rescheduling support, while travel agencies are providing real-time updates to stranded passengers.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Mar 2026 10:03:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://images.whalesbook.com/images/thumbnail_69a40ed9edbd0c0ef0197081_1772359512780.jpeg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>India's Chip Ambition: Production Surge Amidst Global Challenges</title><link>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Tech/Indias-Chip-Ambition-Production-Surge-Amidst-Global-Challenges/69a40e04edbd0c0ef0196f68</link><guid>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Tech/Indias-Chip-Ambition-Production-Surge-Amidst-Global-Challenges/69a40e04edbd0c0ef0196f68</guid><description>India's semiconductor drive accelerates with Micron's Sanand facility commencing production and three more plants slated for 2026.
