The new VB-G RAM G scheme has secured a dominant 40% share (Rs 95,692 crore), eclipsing the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), which faces a drastic 66% funding cut to Rs 30,000 crore. This reallocation, analyzed by PRS Legislative Research, also boosts allocations for rural housing (PMAY-G) and rural roads (PMGSY). Crucially, VB-G RAM G introduces a 60:40 Centre-State funding model, shifting fiscal burden compared to MGNREGA's predominantly central funding, potentially increasing state expenditure on rural programs.</description><pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2026 17:06:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://images.whalesbook.com/images/thumbnail_6991fd052e6a0b8ae17c4cff_1771175302540.jpeg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>AI Wave Hits Wealth Management; India Regulators Tighten Grip</title><link>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Banking-Finance/AI-Wave-Hits-Wealth-Management-India-Regulators-Tighten-Grip/6991fa012e6a0b8ae17c4b57</link><guid>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Banking-Finance/AI-Wave-Hits-Wealth-Management-India-Regulators-Tighten-Grip/6991fa012e6a0b8ae17c4b57</guid><description>The AI revolution is expanding its reach beyond India's IT sector, now posing a direct threat to the operational models and fee structures of wealth management firms.

This concentrated buying, representing 45% of total MF equity purchases that month, signals a strategic pivot driven by perceived attractive valuations after a period of underperformance against public sector banks. However, this influx occurs as PSBs demonstrate robust advance growth and competitive deposit-gathering, while valuations for some private banks are nearing or entering 'expensive' territory, raising questions about sustainability.</description><pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2026 16:53:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://images.whalesbook.com/images/thumbnail_6991f9f72e6a0b8ae17c4b3f_1771174600832.jpeg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Auto Ancillaries Surge on Exports, Masking Global Risks</title><link>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Auto/Auto-Ancillaries-Surge-on-Exports-Masking-Global-Risks/6991f9f62e6a0b8ae17c4b29</link><guid>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Auto/Auto-Ancillaries-Surge-on-Exports-Masking-Global-Risks/6991f9f62e6a0b8ae17c4b29</guid><description>Auto ancillary stocks are outperforming due to strong Q3 results, favorable trade pacts with the EU, UK, and US, and global supply chain diversification.

Societies fear the stringent, dual regulatory oversight from the RBI, in addition to existing state registrars, will impose prohibitive costs and operational complexities. This reluctance stems from a desire to preserve their distinct community-centric governance and localized trust, which they believe would be compromised under formal banking regulations. Recent RBI reforms aimed at strengthening co-operative banks might not be enough to offset these deep-seated concerns about losing operational autonomy.</description><pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2026 14:47:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://images.whalesbook.com/images/thumbnail_6991dc8e878851adec4d71c3_1771166954417.jpeg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Bain Capital Navigates RBI Hurdles for Manappuram Finance Stake</title><link>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Banking-Finance/Bain-Capital-Navigates-RBI-Hurdles-for-Manappuram-Finance-Stake/6991dbf6878851adec4d7134</link><guid>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Banking-Finance/Bain-Capital-Navigates-RBI-Hurdles-for-Manappuram-Finance-Stake/6991dbf6878851adec4d7134</guid><description>Bain Capital's significant investment in Manappuram Finance is proceeding under a conditional approval from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

This strategic move signals Bain's focus on Manappuram's strong market position in gold loans and its potential for growth, despite the cost of regulatory compliance and divestment.

While this surge, primarily driven by renewables like solar and wind, signifies a monumental stride in its energy transition, it simultaneously magnifies existing vulnerabilities in grid stability and necessitates substantial investment in storage and infrastructure upgrades to manage intermittency and ensure reliable power delivery. The rapid expansion, though record-breaking, highlights an ongoing tension between capacity targets and the practicalities of grid management, demanding a critical reassessment of integration strategies.</description><pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2026 14:17:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://images.whalesbook.com/images/thumbnail_6991d566878851adec4d6d9e_1771165221627.jpeg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>India's Oil Pivot: Strategic Realignment or Costly Gamble?</title><link>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Energy/Indias-Oil-Pivot-Strategic-Realignment-or-Costly-Gamble/6991d554878851adec4d6d61</link><guid>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Energy/Indias-Oil-Pivot-Strategic-Realignment-or-Costly-Gamble/6991d554878851adec4d6d61</guid><description>India's directive to shift from Russian crude oil imports to US and Venezuelan sources signals a strategic geopolitical pivot but introduces considerable economic friction. Moody's Analytics highlights that this transition will inevitably drive up domestic energy prices and strain India's fiscal balance due to extensive fuel subsidies. Refineries face higher processing costs adapting to different crude grades, while the lack of detailed trade agreement terms introduces uncertainty. The move reflects a broader effort to diversify energy sources, though immediate full replacement of Russian supplies is deemed infeasible in the near term.</description><pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2026 14:16:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://images.whalesbook.com/images/headline-6991d554878851adec4d6d60.jpg.jpeg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Zydus Lifesciences Revenue Surges 30%, Settles US Patent Case</title><link>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Other/Zydus-Lifesciences-Revenue-Surges-30percent-Settles-US-Patent-Case/6991cfc3878851adec4d6bed</link><guid>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Other/Zydus-Lifesciences-Revenue-Surges-30percent-Settles-US-Patent-Case/6991cfc3878851adec4d6bed</guid><description>Zydus Lifesciences posted a strong Q3 FY26, with revenue jumping 30% year-on-year to ₹68.6 billion and EBITDA up 31%.
