This downturn is attributed to bearish secondary market sentiment, disappointing post-listing performances, and eroded retail investor confidence. Experts note that cautious investors are now preferring beaten-down listed stocks over new issues, leading many firms to defer their listings until market conditions stabilize.</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2026 14:37:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://images.whalesbook.com/images/thumbnail_699088992c7cdffb0a9c7746_1771079931816.jpeg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>GRSE Lays Keel for GSI Research Vessels, Expands Defence &amp; Civilian Order Book</title><link>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Industrial-Goods-Services/GRSE-Lays-Keel-for-GSI-Research-Vessels-Expands-Defence-and-Civilian-Order-Book/6990714f2c7cdffb0a9b3ce6</link><guid>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Industrial-Goods-Services/GRSE-Lays-Keel-for-GSI-Research-Vessels-Expands-Defence-and-Civilian-Order-Book/6990714f2c7cdffb0a9b3ce6</guid><description>Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineers Ltd.

However, the continent captures a fraction of the value, hampered by a "conversion deficit"—a lack of processing capacity and infrastructure. Geopolitical tensions are compelling nations to seek diversified mineral sources, presenting Africa an opportunity to move beyond raw material export. Key developments include Mozambique's graphite expansion, Ghana's gold reserve strategy, and renewed uranium production in Namibia and Niger.
