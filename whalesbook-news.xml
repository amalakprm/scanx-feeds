The transaction, which utilized GIFT City as a key financial gateway, supports Piramal Finance's strategic objective of diversifying its funding sources and securing cost-effective capital for its expansion into India's hinterland.

This implies insurers paid ₹86.98 in claims for every ₹100 in premiums, yielding a 13.02% underwriting margin. However, this overall improvement masks significant distress within the group health insurance segment, which accounts for over half the market. Public sector insurers, in particular, are facing substantial underwriting losses in this segment, with claims ratios exceeding 100%. This situation suggests individual policies may be subsidizing corporate group plans, creating an unsustainable financial dynamic for some entities.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 19:59:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://images.whalesbook.com/images/thumbnail_698b8e2f18b456c009676474_1770755251343.jpeg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Gold/Silver ETFs Outshine Equities as Investors Seek Safety</title><link>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Commodities/GoldSilver-ETFs-Outshine-Equities-as-Investors-Seek-Safety/698b8dce18b456c009676431</link><guid>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Commodities/GoldSilver-ETFs-Outshine-Equities-as-Investors-Seek-Safety/698b8dce18b456c009676431</guid><description>Precious metal ETFs registered unprecedented net inflows of approximately ₹33,000 crore in January 2026, eclipsing the ₹24,029 crore captured by equity funds. This surge, driven by dramatic commodity price rallies and a weakening rupee, signals a pronounced 'performance chasing' behavior and heightened investor anxiety over equity market volatility.

This strategic pivot emphasizes productivity gains and a demand for specialized skills in technology, risk, and analytics over bulk recruitment.

This is driven by steeper discounts on Urals crude, weaker global prices, and a strengthening ruble, which erodes the rouble-equivalent value of export earnings. Shipments to India have fallen sharply, while an increasing number of tankers are rerouting towards China.
