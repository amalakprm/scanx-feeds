The penalty stems from an "India-Specific Warranty Policy" enforced between April 2016 and April 2024, which denied warranty services to Indian consumers purchasing genuine Intel processors through parallel importers. This practice is found to have harmed competition and limited consumer choice in a significant market for Intel.</description><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 09:28:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://images.whalesbook.com/images/thumbnail_699434c5cffb93b3e927ea81_1771320702396.jpeg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>India's Strategic Pivot: Navigating Global Volatility from a Position of Strength</title><link>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/World-Affairs/Indias-Strategic-Pivot-Navigating-Global-Volatility-from-a-Position-of-Strength/6994347dcffb93b3e927e9f5</link><guid>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/World-Affairs/Indias-Strategic-Pivot-Navigating-Global-Volatility-from-a-Position-of-Strength/6994347dcffb93b3e927e9f5</guid><description>External Affairs Minister S.

This mandate, designed to fund a worker welfare fund, imposes collection and remittance responsibilities on platforms like Zomato and Swiggy. While intended to benefit gig workers, the levy introduces a new layer of operational complexity and financial strain on aggregators already navigating a competitive and margin-sensitive market. The capped structure across various service categories adds further complexity, forcing platforms to re-evaluate their cost structures and pricing strategies.</description><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 09:25:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://images.whalesbook.com/images/thumbnail_69943407cffb93b3e927e8f9_1771320494450.jpeg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exponent One Unlocks Commercial EV Growth with Data-Driven Finance</title><link>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Transportation/Exponent-One-Unlocks-Commercial-EV-Growth-with-Data-Driven-Finance/69943402cffb93b3e927e8e3</link><guid>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Transportation/Exponent-One-Unlocks-Commercial-EV-Growth-with-Data-Driven-Finance/69943402cffb93b3e927e8e3</guid><description>Exponent Energy has launched Exponent One, a dedicated fintech and asset management venture aimed at overcoming financing hurdles for commercial electric vehicles (CEVs).

Module utilization has plummeted to around 40%. While leading firms like Waaree Energies and Adani Solar hold significant market share, the sector faces intense cost pressures, the obsolescence of older technologies like MonoPERC, and reduced export competitiveness due to US tariffs.
