Union Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal emphasized that decisions regarding India's energy imports, including Russian crude oil, are solely made by domestic buyers and are not dictated by this trade pact. This strategic decoupling allows India to diversify energy sources while securing preferential market access and enhancing its competitive edge. The agreement, however, introduces new geopolitical considerations and analyst skepticism regarding India's energy sourcing commitments and the scale of US import pledges.</description><pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2026 18:16:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://images.whalesbook.com/images/thumbnail_6988d2f3b81b2b81dcfd84c0_1770574716637.jpeg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>CreditAccess India Eyes Investor Exit Amid Microfinance Shift</title><link>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Banking-Finance/CreditAccess-India-Eyes-Investor-Exit-Amid-Microfinance-Shift/6988cd4fb81b2b81dcfd829e</link><guid>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Banking-Finance/CreditAccess-India-Eyes-Investor-Exit-Amid-Microfinance-Shift/6988cd4fb81b2b81dcfd829e</guid><description>CreditAccess India BV is actively seeking strategic investors to facilitate exits for long-term shareholders, signaling a proactive approach to liquidity and future growth.

Niti Aayog member VK Saraswat highlighted this push, but simultaneously underscored a critical shortfall in venture capital support for maturing defence startups. This creates a dual narrative of robust government investment clashing with private capital's perceived hesitation, potentially impacting scaling and innovation despite the sector's growth trajectory. The market's muted reaction post-budget suggests investor caution regarding these underlying dynamics.</description><pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2026 17:44:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://images.whalesbook.com/images/thumbnail_6988cb6eb81b2b81dcfd80f0_1770572790379.jpeg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Nifty Rebalance: Capital Seesaw to Impact Tata Motors, HDFC AMC, Info Edge</title><link>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Stock-Investment-Ideas/Nifty-Rebalance-Capital-Seesaw-to-Impact-Tata-Motors-HDFC-AMC-Info-Edge/6988c6bfb81b2b81dcfd7eb5</link><guid>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Stock-Investment-Ideas/Nifty-Rebalance-Capital-Seesaw-to-Impact-Tata-Motors-HDFC-AMC-Info-Edge/6988c6bfb81b2b81dcfd7eb5</guid><description>The upcoming rebalancing of the Nifty Next 50 index is projected to inject significant capital into specific stocks, with Tata Motors anticipated to receive approximately ₹1,296 crore in passive inflows, followed by HDFC Asset Management Company with an estimated ₹734 crore.
