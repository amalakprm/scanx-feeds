The proposed 'de minimis' threshold aims to shift minor investments from a case-by-case approval process to automatic clearance, reducing compliance burdens and accelerating capital flow. While the core security vetting for investments from bordering nations, particularly China, remains intact, this recalibration seeks to balance national security with economic facilitation, especially for sectors needing capital but lacking sensitive technologies. This policy adjustment aligns with India's broader industrial objectives, including the 'Make in India' initiative.</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 17:53:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://images.whalesbook.com/images/headline-69935983823bbe715bc9791d.jpg.jpeg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>IndiGo Extends Iran-Linked Flight Cuts; Operational Strain Mounts</title><link>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Transportation/IndiGo-Extends-Iran-Linked-Flight-Cuts-Operational-Strain-Mounts/699354e3823bbe715bc8e6bc</link><guid>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Transportation/IndiGo-Extends-Iran-Linked-Flight-Cuts-Operational-Strain-Mounts/699354e3823bbe715bc8e6bc</guid><description>IndiGo has extended flight cancellations for routes serving Tbilisi, Almaty, Baku, and Tashkent until March 28, 2026, citing ongoing geopolitical developments impacting Iranian airspace.

Despite projections of strong GDP expansion in FY27, the central bank is cautious, balancing domestic stability against global headwinds like geopolitical tensions and capital flow volatility. Inflation, though showing moderation in core components, is influenced by food normalization and commodity price movements, necessitating continued vigilance and limiting scope for immediate rate cuts.
