Anantha Nageswaran primarily to global economic headwinds and volatile capital flows, rather than domestic fiscal measures. While acknowledging the rupee is "punching below its weight," Nageswaran noted its weaker value provides a buffer against global tariffs and bolsters export competitiveness. A sustained currency recovery hinges on improved global sentiment, potentially aided by a resolution to trade tensions with the United States.
