However, a deeper examination reveals that some of these names, like CG Power and Thermax, trade at significantly higher P/E multiples than their sector averages, signaling potential valuation concerns. This contrasts with the positive technical indicators, suggesting that while short-term upside is possible, the underlying fundamentals and market breadth may pose risks to sustained rallies.</description><pubDate>Sun, 22 Feb 2026 20:31:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://images.whalesbook.com/images/thumbnail_699b678eee97f501b0ea691b_1771792417058.jpeg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Indian Streamers Gobble Satellite Rights Amidst Consolidation</title><link>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Media-and-Entertainment/Indian-Streamers-Gobble-Satellite-Rights-Amidst-Consolidation/699b5fa9ee97f501b0ea65ea</link><guid>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Media-and-Entertainment/Indian-Streamers-Gobble-Satellite-Rights-Amidst-Consolidation/699b5fa9ee97f501b0ea65ea</guid><description>Pure-play streamers in India are actively acquiring satellite rights, particularly for mid- and small-budget films, a trend accelerating over the past two months. This strategic shift is driven by the burgeoning digital media sector's robust growth (over 20%) contrasted with meager television advertising expansion (&lt;5%). The recent consolidation in the market, notably the Viacom18-Disney Star merger, has concentrated power among major platforms, severely impacting satellite rights valuations which have reportedly declined by 80-90%. Digital rights now constitute approximately 75% of a film's non-theatrical revenue, with satellite rights contributing a mere 20-25%, forcing producers to bundle rights and accept altered deal dynamics.</description><pubDate>Sun, 22 Feb 2026 19:57:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://images.whalesbook.com/images/thumbnail_699b5fa9ee97f501b0ea65e9_1771790364090.jpeg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Palfinger Bets Big on India: Localizing Crane Production for Growth</title><link>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Industrial-Goods-Services/Palfinger-Bets-Big-on-India-Localizing-Crane-Production-for-Growth/699b5f9cee97f501b0ea65cc</link><guid>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Industrial-Goods-Services/Palfinger-Bets-Big-on-India-Localizing-Crane-Production-for-Growth/699b5f9cee97f501b0ea65cc</guid><description>Palfinger AG is localizing manufacturing in India with a ₹350 crore investment in a Pune facility, set to begin production by 2027.

This multi-technology approach contrasts with rivals focusing heavily on electrification, amidst robust 2025 sales growth of 36%. The strategy acknowledges India's slower EV uptake and infrastructure limitations, yet risks diluting focus as competitors like Maruti Suzuki dominate CNG and Tata Motors pushes EVs.

This RBI-driven initiative seeks to incentivize sound risk management and financial stability, though it may increase annual payouts by ₹2,000-12,000 crore and potentially alter deposit mobilization dynamics. Critics question the scale of premiums relative to low historical claims, especially as the central bank possesses powers to avert bank failures.

This trend, driven by a post-pandemic structural shift in savings behavior, signals a growing preference for managed investments over direct stock picking. While overall household equity wealth has surged, the declining share of direct individual ownership to multi-year lows highlights a significant divergence in retail participation strategies.
