This marks a strategic shift prioritizing economic security via enhanced self-reliance and carefully chosen partnerships, countering global volatility. With robust economic forecasts and a focus on supply chain diversification, India is positioning itself as a stable, strategic player in a fractured world order. The nation is actively recalibrating its economic strategy from its 1991 liberalization origins towards greater autonomy.</description><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 21:03:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://images.whalesbook.com/images/headline-6994d7903ec8b0ccb20d6457.jpg.jpeg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>OMC Profits Surge: Refining Gains Mask Marketing Margin Squeeze</title><link>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Energy/OMC-Profits-Surge-Refining-Gains-Mask-Marketing-Margin-Squeeze/6994c88f3ec8b0ccb20d613a</link><guid>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Energy/OMC-Profits-Surge-Refining-Gains-Mask-Marketing-Margin-Squeeze/6994c88f3ec8b0ccb20d613a</guid><description>State-owned oil marketing companies (OMCs) IOC, BPCL, and HPCL have more than doubled their combined quarterly profit to ₹23,743 crore, driven by a fourfold increase in gross refining margins (GRM) and government compensation for LPG under-recoveries. However, this stellar performance is juxtaposed against a significant decline in marketing margins for petrol and diesel, indicating a bifurcated business segment performance. While refining operations thrived due to softer crude prices and strong product crack spreads, retail fuel sales faced margin compression.</description><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 19:59:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://images.whalesbook.com/images/headline-6994c88f3ec8b0ccb20d6139.jpg.jpeg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Bajaj Auto Loses Ground as Premium Bikes Dominate Market</title><link>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Auto/Bajaj-Auto-Loses-Ground-as-Premium-Bikes-Dominate-Market/6994c8133ec8b0ccb20d60a9</link><guid>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Auto/Bajaj-Auto-Loses-Ground-as-Premium-Bikes-Dominate-Market/6994c8133ec8b0ccb20d60a9</guid><description>Indian consumers are increasingly favoring higher-powered, premium motorcycles, driving sales of bikes 125cc and above to a five-year high.

This shift, fueled by rising aspirations and improved affordability via GST reductions, highlights a critical challenge for manufacturers lagging in the premium segment, despite entry-level bikes still holding the majority share.</description><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 19:57:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://images.whalesbook.com/images/thumbnail_6994c8133ec8b0ccb20d60a8_1771358363604.jpeg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Nestle India Asserts Local Safety Amidst Global Recall, Trust Imperiled</title><link>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Consumer-Products/Nestle-India-Asserts-Local-Safety-Amidst-Global-Recall-Trust-Imperiled/6994c80f3ec8b0ccb20d6092</link><guid>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Consumer-Products/Nestle-India-Asserts-Local-Safety-Amidst-Global-Recall-Trust-Imperiled/6994c80f3ec8b0ccb20d6092</guid><description>Amid international product recalls due to cereulide contamination, Nestle India has emphasized that its infant formula brands, including Nan Pro, Lactogen, and Nan Grow, are manufactured locally and meet all FSSAI standards. Despite these assurances, the company navigates significant reputational risks and a premium valuation, as analysts express mixed views on its future performance.

Rising input costs for copper and steel, coupled with a depreciating rupee, are pressuring margins and fueling anticipated price hikes. While companies express optimism for pent-up demand, retailers' caution and the need to clear existing stock present considerable headwinds. The sector's performance is increasingly divergent, with some players showing signs of financial strain while others focus on premiumization and technological integration for future growth.</description><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 19:35:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://images.whalesbook.com/images/headline-6994c301fe3bff43302bcbe5.jpg.jpeg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>India Weighs CTUIL-Grid India Merger Amid Transmission Overhaul</title><link>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Energy/India-Weighs-CTUIL-Grid-India-Merger-Amid-Transmission-Overhaul/6994c300fe3bff43302bcbcf</link><guid>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Energy/India-Weighs-CTUIL-Grid-India-Merger-Amid-Transmission-Overhaul/6994c300fe3bff43302bcbcf</guid><description>New Delhi is again pushing to merge Central Transmission Utility of India Ltd. (CTUIL) with Grid Controller of India (Grid India). The proposal aims to eliminate potential conflicts of interest in awarding power transmission projects and establish a level playing field for all bidders. CTUIL, currently a Power Grid Corporation subsidiary, handles inter-state transmission planning and coordination. This strategic consolidation follows a similar, inconclusive proposal in 2023, with Grid India now tasked to prepare a comprehensive roadmap. The move seeks to create a more structured system for transmission capacity additions amidst surging power demand and ambitious renewable energy targets.</description><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 19:35:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://images.whalesbook.com/images/thumbnail_6994c300fe3bff43302bcbce_1771357098583.jpeg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>India Pivots Steel Exports Amid EU Carbon Tax Pressure</title><link>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Industrial-Goods-Services/India-Pivots-Steel-Exports-Amid-EU-Carbon-Tax-Pressure/6994c2effe3bff43302bcbb3</link><guid>https://www.whalesbook.com/news/English/Industrial-Goods-Services/India-Pivots-Steel-Exports-Amid-EU-Carbon-Tax-Pressure/6994c2effe3bff43302bcbb3</guid><description>India's steel sector is actively diversifying export markets away from the European Union, which recently implemented a carbon tax (CBAM). With two-thirds of exports historically flowing to Europe, the industry is now targeting infrastructure-heavy economies in the Middle East and Asia. This strategic shift intensifies competition, particularly against China, while raising concerns about India's significant reliance on imported coking coal and the potential for global trade protectionism.

This strategic pivot aims to retain subscribers and expand reach into the 50-60 million CTV households.

This strategic pivot is happening concurrently with a strong push towards cash recycler deployments, which are expected to constitute over 75% of new installations. Despite the rise of digital payments, physical cash demand remains robust, underscoring the continued relevance of modernized ATM networks.

While this move could ease global price pressures and improve trade flows, it introduces specific headwinds for companies like Novelis, a Hindalco subsidiary, which had benefited from tariff-induced supply tightness and elevated premiums. The market is reacting with caution, awaiting further clarity on the scope and implementation of any changes, as demonstrated by mixed reactions in US and Indian stock exchanges.
