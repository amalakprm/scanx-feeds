<description><![CDATA[
Top News Global Infrastructure Partners to Invest Up to INR 3,000 Crores in Aditya Birla Renewables 19 minutes ago Grasim Industries Limited announced that Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), part of BlackRock, will invest up to INR 3,000 crore in its renewable energy subsidiary, Aditya Birla Renewables Limited (ABREN). The investment includes INR 2,000 crore committed and an additional INR 1,000 crore as a greenshoe option. Essel Mining & Industries Limited will also invest INR 500 crore. This values ABREN at an enterprise value of INR 14,600 crore. As a result, ABREN will no longer be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Grasim but will remain a subsidiary. The investment is expected to bring strategic expertise and capital for ABREN's growth in the renewable energy sector.
