<description><![CDATA[
EIA Raises Brent Crude Price Projections for 2025 and 2026 29 minutes ago The Energy Information Administration (EIA) has modestly increased its Brent crude oil price projections. For 2025, the forecast has been raised by $0.15 to $68.91 per barrel. The 2026 projection has been increased by $0.16 to $55.08 per barrel. These small upward revisions suggest a slightly more optimistic outlook on medium-term oil prices, potentially reflecting changes in global oil market dynamics.
