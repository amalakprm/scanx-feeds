<description><![CDATA[
Top News Callista Industries Revises Preferential Issue Plan, Adjusts Warrant and Equity Share Allocation 3 minutes ago Callista Industries Limited has announced changes to its preferential allotment plan. The revised plan reduces convertible warrants from 3,37,50,000 to 2,93,50,000 and increases equity shares for non-promoters from 12,50,000 to 56,50,000. The allocation includes 81,00,000 warrants to promoter Rashmi Ravi Sharma and 55,00,000 to Koriander Consultants LLP. Non-promoter equity share allocations include 10,00,000 to Koriander Consultants LLP. The company will issue a corrigendum to the AGM notice and seek shareholder approval for these changes. The revision comes amid concerning financial indicators, including negative shareholders' capital and increasing non-current liabilities.
