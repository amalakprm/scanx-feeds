The investment includes INR 2,000 crore committed and an additional INR 1,000 crore as a greenshoe option. Essel Mining & Industries Limited will also invest INR 500 crore. This values ABREN at an enterprise value of INR 14,600 crore. As a result, ABREN will no longer be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Grasim but will remain a subsidiary. The investment is expected to bring strategic expertise and capital for ABREN's growth in the renewable energy sector.
