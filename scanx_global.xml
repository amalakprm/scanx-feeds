<link>https://scanx.trade/stock-market-news/stock-market-news/global/china-implements-export-licensing-requirements-for-select-steel-products-from-january-1/27076380</link>
<description><![CDATA[
Top News China Implements Export Licensing Requirements for Select Steel Products 3 hours ago China has announced new export licensing requirements for certain steel products, effective January 1. This regulatory measure introduces administrative controls over steel exports, marking a significant shift in China's steel industry trade policy. The new system requires exporters to obtain authorization before shipping affected steel categories internationally. This change may impact global steel markets and supply chains, with potential implications for countries relying on Chinese steel imports.
