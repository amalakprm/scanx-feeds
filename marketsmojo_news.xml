However, the headline growth conceals a troubling profitability collapse, as consolidated net profit plummeted 87.65% QoQ to just ₹0.21 crores from ₹1.70 crores in the previous quarter. The stock, currently trading at ₹12.80, has declined 9.95% year-to-date and remains 30.25% below its 52-week high of ₹18.35, reflecting investor concerns about the company's deteriorating earnings quality despite topline expansion.
