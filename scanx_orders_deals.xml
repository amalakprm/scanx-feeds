<description><![CDATA[
Top News Shriram Pistons Acquires Antolin India for ₹16,700 cr 14 hours ago Shriram Pistons & Rings Limited has agreed to acquire 100% shareholding in Grupo Antolin's Indian operations for €159 million (₹16,700 crores). The acquisition includes three entities: Antolin Lighting India, Grupo Antolin India, and Grupo Antolin Chakankar, operating five manufacturing facilities. The acquired companies, with annual revenues of ₹1,179.10 crores and EBITDA margins of 9-10%, are leading suppliers of automotive interior solutions in India. This strategic move will diversify Shriram's portfolio into powertrain-agnostic products, expected to constitute 35% of consolidated revenue post-acquisition. The deal includes a technology licensing agreement with Antolin and will be financed primarily through existing cash reserves.
