The Indian rupee saw a steep loss of 42 paise to settle at 91.50 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday after US and Israeli attacks on Iran intensified worldwide risk aversion, setting crude oil prices surginvg and demand for the American currency soaring.

Indian shares tumbled on Monday as the possibility of prolonged turmoil in the Middle East and the ripple effects of higher oil prices prompted traders to move funds into safe-haven assets.

The S&P BSE Sensex tanked 1,048.34 points or 1.29% to 80,238.85. The Nifty 50 index dropped 312.95 points or 1.24% to 24,865.70.

West Asia Conflict: The United States and Israel have launched major coordinated military strikes on Iran, marking a significant escalation in long-running Middle East tensions. On 1 March 2026, Iran launches missile and drone strikes on U.S. bases across six Middle Eastern countries amid escalating military tensions. Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was reportedly killed in the attacks, escalating tensions further.

Numbers to Track: In the commodities market, Brent crude for May 2026 settlement surged $5.73 or 7.86%, to $78.60 a barrel amid heightened geopolitical tensions.

Asian indices ended lower after the United States and Israel launched their most ambitious attacks on Iran in decades, killing Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. U.S. and Israeli strikes, and the Iranian retaliation, have sent shockwaves across the Middle East and through sectors from shipping to air travel to oil on warnings of rising energy costs and disruption to business in the Gulf, a strategic waterway and global trade hub. Most Gulf equities fell on Sunday, though Boursa Kuwait suspended trading and the UAE ordered its stock markets closed on Monday, a sign of the growing economic disruption sweeping the Gulf.

InterGlobe Aviation, the parent of IndiGo, dropped 6.30%, while SpiceJet declined 5.35% amid concerns over rising operational challenges. The conflict involving Israel, the United States and Iran has led to multiple airspace shutdowns across the Middle East, significantly affecting international flight routes, particularly those connecting India to Europe via major Gulf hubs. At the same time, a spike in global crude oil prices has added to investor worries, as higher fuel costs directly impact airline profitability. The Indian Association of Tour Operators reported a noticeable increase in booking cancellations and rescheduling requests on Sunday, citing disruptions caused by airspace restrictions. The ongoing crisis has heightened uncertainty for the aviation sector, with investors factoring in the dual impact of disrupted routes and elevated fuel expenses.

Oil prices surged sharply on Monday, with WTI crude oil futures climbing more than 8% to trade above $72 per barrel, the highest level in over eight months, after earlier gains of nearly 10%. The rally followed unprecedented joint US and Israeli strikes on Iran, sharply escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. Markets are closely watching the risk of supply disruptions through the Strait of Hormuz, which carries around one-fifth of global oil flows. While Iran said the strait remains open, several shipping firms began rerouting vessels. Tehran also launched retaliatory missile strikes on US bases across the region. The rally came despite OPEC+ agreeing to raise output by 206,000 barrels per day in April, ending a three-month pause.
