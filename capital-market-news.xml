Indian equities face a mixed start to the week of 17 – 23 Jan 2026, with recent macro cues underlining a cautious tone. Persistent foreign institutional selling emerged as a drag, offsetting domestic investor support and keeping valuations under pressure as volatility persisted. Investors would continue to track the slew of data release scheduled for released next week. The focus would also remain on corporate announcements as the latest earnings season enters its next leg in the coming week. In India, the M3 Money Supply figures for the week ended on January 09 would be made public on Wednesday (21 January 2026).

The HSBC India Manufacturing PMI fell to 55.0 in December 2025, revised lower from initial estimates of 55.7, down from 56.6 in November.

The HSBC India Services PMI was revised lower to 58.0 in December 2025 from a preliminary estimate of 59.1 and a final reading of 59.8 in November. The latest figure marked the softest expansion in the services sector since January 2025, as new business and output eased to 11-month lows. The HSBC India Composite PMI slipped to 57.8 in December 2025, below the flash estimate of 58.9 and down from 59.7 in November. The latest reading marked the lowest since the beginning of the year, reflecting slower momentum across both manufacturing and services sectors.

    <description><![CDATA[Benchmark equity indices closed with modest gains on Friday, ending a two-day losing streak, as buying interest returned to IT stocks following Infosys’ better-than-expected quarterly performance and an upgrade to its full-year revenue growth outlook.

Benchmark equity indices closed with modest gains on Friday, ending a two-day losing streak, as buying interest returned to IT stocks following Infosys’ better-than-expected quarterly performance and an upgrade to its full-year revenue growth outlook. Market sentiment also drew support from the ongoing December-quarter earnings season, with investors awaiting the Q3 results of Reliance Industries later in the day. Gains in IT shares, along with select banking stocks, helped the Nifty settle above the 25,650 level. Adding to the positive tone, early trends from the Maharashtra assembly elections showed the BJP-Shiv Sena alliance in the lead.

This marked a dramatic end to Shiv Sena (UBT)'s 30-year dominance, as UBT along with MNS and NCP(SP) trailed at 58-68 seats, while Congress allies managed 10-31, amid a 52.94% voter turnout from 12.4 million voters across Mumbai's wards. Economy: The India’s exports grew 1.87% to $38.5 billion in December last year due to global economic uncertainties, while an increase in imports led to a marginal widening of the trade deficit to $25 billion.

On a nine-month basis, the company’s consolidated net profit rose 2.95% YoY to Rs 87.72 crore, while revenue increased 4.71% YoY to Rs 676.50 crore in 9M FY26 compared with 9M FY25. Pradeep Gupta, chairman and managing director, said, " The Indian capital markets had a rough ride in FY26, with the Sensex and Nifty delivering lacklustre gains; under-performing other significant global peers. There was pressure from sustained selling by foreign investors, citing concerns over weak earnings, stretched valuations and currency volatility, which resulted in the benchmark indices remaining subdued despite brief mid-year rallies. Despite this backdrop, our business continued to grow. We delivered strong broking revenues, with Assets under Custody rising 48% year-on-year to Rs 1.06 trillion, an affirmation of our clients' trust and our disciplined approach to financial stewardship. Our non-broking businesses also registered meaningful growth, with the MTF book expanding 46% YoY to Rs 12,317 million and Assets under Management increasing 32% Yo Y to Rs 83,688 million. We will continue our focus on de-risking and stabilizing our earnings through increased exposure in the non-broking segments. In the era of discount and algorithm broking, we remain customer-oriented and our approach will always be relationship-based which is why over 54% of our clients have been with us since longer than 3 years. We take great pride in the enduring relationships that we have built - an affirmation about the consistency of our service, the relevance of our offerings and the strength of our brand."

The US dollar index climbed to over a month high on Friday after yesterday’s improved jobless claims report reduced bets of a near term Fed rate cut. Data from the US Department of Labor (DOL) showed Initial Jobless Claims unexpectedly fell to 198K in the week ended January 10, below market expectations of 215K and down from the prior week’s revised 207K. The data confirmed that layoffs remain limited and that the labor market is holding up despite an extended period of high borrowing costs. Moreover, market sentiment improved after US President Donald Trump reportedly said he has no plans to remove Fed Chair Jerome Powell. The dollar index that measures the greenback against a basket of currencies is quoting at 99.11, marginally lower on the day but extending gains for the third week in a row.

Gold prices edged down to around $4,600 per ounce in Asian electronic trading on Friday, extending Thursday’s modest losses as safe-haven demand softened and expectations of an imminent Federal Reserve rate cut faded. Geopolitical concerns in Iran eased after President Donald Trump indicated a possible delay in military action, following Iran’s pledge not to execute protesters. The US dollar index remained steady around 99, supported by robust economic data that tempered bets on near-term interest rate reductions, pushing the next fully priced Fed rate cut from June to July. In India, MCX February delivery bullion futures traded little changed at Rs 1,43,074 per 10 grams, maintaining momentum for a weekly gain of over 3%, having touched fresh highs of Rs 1,43,590 earlier in the week.
