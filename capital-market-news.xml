Gold futures slipped below the $5,000 per ounce mark in electronic trade on Friday, with prices set to close the week with modest gains following last week’s extreme volatility, which saw swings of nearly $1,000. The precious metal faced headwinds from profit-taking after recent record highs, alongside renewed strength in the US dollar. The dollar found support after President Donald Trump nominated Kevin Warsh as the next Federal Reserve Chair, with markets viewing Warsh as favoring a smaller balance sheet and a more measured approach to policy easing. Geopolitical sentiment also remained cautious, as the White House signaled a preference for diplomacy with Iran. On the domestic front, MCX April gold futures recovered from intraday lows and traded marginally higher after touching Rs 149,396 per 10 grams.

    <description><![CDATA[Revenue from operations rose 14% to Rs 3,830.7 crore, compared with Rs 3,360 crore in the same quarter last year.

Revenue from operations rose 14% to Rs 3,830.7 crore, compared with Rs 3,360 crore in the same quarter last year. Profitability was impacted by forex losses and a one-time charge related to the implementation of the new labour codes. The company reported a profit before exceptional items and tax of Rs 429.2 crore, down from Rs 489.1 crore a year ago. The quarter included exceptional items of Rs 74.3 crore, primarily on account of increased employee benefit provisions following the new labour codes effective 21 November 2025. On 8 August 2025, the board had approved changing the financial year from October–September to April-March. The current financial year spans 1 October 2024 – 31 March 2026 (18 months). Thereafter, FYs will run April-March. The company’s new orders during the quarter increased by 19% YoY to Rs 4,829 crore in December quarter, while order backlog grew by 7% at Rs 43,004 crore. Sunil Mathur, managing director and chief executive officer of Siemens, said, “India’s economic resilience continues to stand out even as adverse geopolitical developments and global uncertainties weigh on sentiment. Despite these external headwinds, Siemens Limited delivered a steady performance this quarter driven by disciplined execution and a healthy order book, resulting in an increase in revenue of 14%. All the businesses performed well during the quarter, contributing to a book-to-bill ratio of 1.26x, with Digital Industries now reflecting normalized operations. This is reflected in the company’s strong performance across all businesses during the quarter, including two significant order wins in the Mobility business. While the Smart Infrastructure business continued to demonstrate strong execution, the performance at the Digital Industries business is now showing signs of recovery, indicating that the destocking phase is now largely over. Looking ahead, we expect additional support from macroeconomic tailwinds as the recently signed India-EU Free Trade Agreement and the trade deal with the US begin opening new avenues for technology collaboration and exports. We welcome the government’s consistent focus on long-term economic growth and structural transformation in the Union Budget 2026-27. The record Rs 12.2 lakh crore capital expenditure allocation, sustained emphasis on infrastructure development, and a fiscal deficit target of around 4.3% indicate a continued and disciplined approach to strengthening India’s growth foundations." Siemens is a leading technology company focused on industry, infrastructure, and mobility.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has come up with a statement on developmental and regulatory policies. Following regulatory policy measures relating to financial markets were announced. Development of corporate bond market: An active derivatives market can facilitate efficient management of credit risks, improve liquidity and efficiency in the corporate bond market and facilitate issuance of corporate bonds across the rating spectrum. An announcement was made in the Union Budget speech delivered on February 1, 2026, that total return swaps on corporate bonds and derivatives on corporate bond indices will be introduced. Accordingly, a regulatory framework to enable the introduction of derivatives on credit indices and total return swaps on corporate bonds will be issued shortly for public feedback. Foreign Exchange Dealings of Authorised Dealers: Banks and standalone primary dealers authorised under FEMA, 1999, access the foreign exchange market for market making, balance sheet management and hedging of risks. The regulatory framework governing the facilities for such Authorised Dealers (ADs) has been reviewed, rationalised and refined in view of the current market practices and requirements, domestically and globally. The revised framework provides these ADs with greater flexibility with respect to foreign exchange products, risk management and platforms. Review of the Voluntary Retention Route for FPI investment in debt instruments: The Voluntary Retention Route (VRR) was introduced by the Reserve Bank in March 2019 to provide an additional channel for investments by Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) with long-term investment interest in the Indian debt markets. Over the years, the Bank has been recalibrating the Route to improve operational flexibilities and ease of doing business. The VRR has been witnessing active investment by FPIs, and over 80 per cent of the current investment limit of ₹2.5 lakh crore has been utilised. With a view to ensuring predictability about the availability of investment limits under the VRR and to further increase ease of doing business, it has been decided that (a) investments under the VRR shall now be reckoned under the limit for FPI investments under the General Route; and (b) certain additional operational flexibilities will be provided to FPIs investing under the VRR. Necessary directions will be separately issued.
