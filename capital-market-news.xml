It also comes after ADP reported last week that private payrolls increased by a mere 22,000 in January. The January consumer price index reading—which was also delayed by the shutdown—is due out Friday, with the consensus looking for a 2.5% annual rate.

Profit before tax jumped 12.37% to Rs 216.39 crore in Q3 FY26 as against Rs 192.56 crore in recorded in Q3 FY25. Revenue from Electrical Cables segment stood at Rs 1,400.44 crore in Q3 FY26, up 44.05% YoY. Revenue from Communication Cables segment stood at Rs 122.76 crore in Q3 FY26, down 5.75% YoY. Revenue from Copper Rods segment stood at Rs 678.20 in Q3 FY26, up 50.37%. In volume terms, Electrical Wires showed a 28% growth; within Communication Cables segment, volume of metal-based products was lower than the corresponding quarter of the previous period, but Optic Fiber Cable volumes grew by 34% during the quarter. Volume growth in the new product categories was impacted by changes to the energy efficiency norms which would become effective from Jan 2026 and hence there was resistance from trade in purchasing additional material. Finolex Cables is India's largest and leading manufacturer of Electrical and Communication cables. Finolex offers a wide range of Electrical and Communication cables. Its wire and cable products are used in applications such as automobile, lighting, cable TV, telephone and computers to industrial applications touching every person in his daily life.

    <description><![CDATA[On a standalone basis, revenue from operations stood at Rs 421.34 crore in Q3 FY26, up 9.4% YoY from Rs 385.18 crore in Q3 FY25.

On a standalone basis, revenue from operations stood at Rs 421.34 crore in Q3 FY26, up 9.4% YoY from Rs 385.18 crore in Q3 FY25. Profit after tax turned positive at Rs 31.86 crore in Q3 FY26, compared with a loss of Rs 2.41 crore in Q3 FY25. PAT margin improved to 7.6% from -0.6% in Q3 FY25. Reported EBITDA excluding other income surged to Rs 59.18 crore in Q3 FY26 from Rs 20 crore a year ago, marking a 195.9% YoY increase, with EBITDA margin expanding sharply to 14% from 5.2%. On an Ind AS basis, EBITDA including other income stood at Rs 70.34 crore, up 158.1% YoY, with margin improving to 16.7% from 7.1% in Q3 FY25. Operating EBITDA rose more than five-fold to Rs 41.64 crore in Q3 FY26 from Rs 7.97 crore in Q3 FY25, translating into a 422.7% YoY increase. Operating EBITDA margin improved to 9.9% from 2.1% in the corresponding quarter last year. During the quarter, the company reported its highest-ever quarterly sales, despite a year-on-year shift in festive demand, as Diwali fell earlier and some purchases were pulled forward into Q2 FY26. Management said GST 2.0 had no impact on Wakefit’s major product categories, with GST rates remaining unchanged at 18%, though Q3 demand saw marginal pressure due to temporary consumption shifts toward categories benefiting from GST reductions. To provide a normalised growth perspective, the company said year-on-year sales growth for the September-December 2025 period stood at around 14%. Demand trends in Q4 FY26 indicate a healthy recovery, with the second half of the year typically being stronger for the business. Gross margin in Q3 FY26 was impacted by seasonal offers and discounts, although it still improved by 230 bps YoY. The company noted that elevated marketing spends by competitors have increased cost intensity in recent quarters, but expects its marketing spends to normalise to 8-9% of sales over the medium term. From a business mix perspective, mattresses contributed 62.3% of Q3 FY26 sales, furniture 28.7%, and furnishings 9.0%. Own channels accounted for 64.5% of sales, while external channels contributed 35.5%. As of 31 December 2025, Wakefit operated 137 active Company-Owned, Company-Operated (COCO) stores across India. Wakefit Innovations’ chairman, CEO and executive director Ankit Garg said that early indicators point to a stronger Q4 FY26, with the company targeting mid- to high-teen revenue growth and further improvement in operating EBITDA margins. He added that post IPO, the company's balance sheet has strengthened significantly, with investable cash of Rs 889.18 crore as of 31 December 2025. Executive director Chaitanya Ramalingegowda said the company continued to leverage its own direct-to-consumer channels to drive growth, with the core mattress business growing 11.7% YoY in the September to December 2025 period, while furniture and furnishings grew a faster 35.6% YoY. He highlighted that this diversification is improving customer repeat behaviour and lifetime value, supported by ongoing retail expansion, with 137 active COCO stores at the end of the quarter. He added that Wakefit remains focused on strengthening its omnichannel model, brand-led growth and operational capabilities to capture long-term opportunities in India’s under-penetrated home and furnishings market. Bengaluru-based Wakefit Innovations is one of India’s largest and fastest-growing D2C home and furnishing solutions companies, with a diversified product portfolio spanning mattresses, furniture and home furnishings, and a growing omnichannel presence. Shares of Wakefit Innovations made their stock market debut on 15 December 2025. The stock listed at Rs 194.10 on the BSE, a marginal discount of 0.46% to the issue price of Rs 195. The company’s initial public offering was subscribed 2.52 times. The IPO opened for bidding on 8 December 2025, and closed on 10 December 2025, with the price band fixed at Rs 185-195 per share.

    <description><![CDATA[Gold futures edged lower on Tuesday, slipping below the $5,070 per ounce mark as a firmer US dollar and pre-data caution weighed on prices.

Gold futures edged lower on Tuesday, slipping below the $5,070 per ounce mark as a firmer US dollar and pre-data caution weighed on prices. Market focus has shifted squarely to upcoming US labour and inflation readings, which are expected to refine expectations around the Federal Reserve’s policy trajectory. While geopolitical tensions continue to lend underlying support to safe-haven demand, near-term price action remains restrained as investors await clarity on the timing and magnitude of potential rate cuts. On the domestic front, MCX April gold futures eased 0.3% to ₹1,57,669 per 10 grams, and is seen consolidating in narrow range after record rally to Rs 190000 late last month.
