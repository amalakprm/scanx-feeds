    <description><![CDATA[The company’s total revenue from operations plunged 88.38% to Rs 306.79 crore in Q3 FY26, down from Rs 2,642.24 crore recorded in the corresponding quarter of the previous year.

The company’s total revenue from operations plunged 88.38% to Rs 306.79 crore in Q3 FY26, down from Rs 2,642.24 crore recorded in the corresponding quarter of the previous year. Pre-tax loss for the quarter stood at Rs 302.87 crore in Q3 FY26, compared to a profit before tax of Rs 211.27 crore in Q3 FY25. The company’s inventory stood at Rs 2,363 crore in Q3 FY26, largely unchanged from Rs 2,383 crore in the previous quarter. Management said the inventory will be converted into finished goods and shipped over the coming months. Trade receivables declined to Rs 3,284 crore at the end of Q3 FY26 from Rs 4,026 crore in Q2, reflecting improved collections. The company reported a cash balance of Rs 537 crore at the end of the quarter. Net debt reduced to Rs 3,349 crore in Q3 FY26 from Rs 3,738 crore in the preceding quarter, primarily due to lower working capital requirements, partially offset by capital expenditure. Gross debt stood at Rs 885 crore, with cash and cash equivalents of Rs 537 crore. During the quarter, the company strengthened its order wins by securing additional packages under Bharatnet Phase-III, where it remains a key supplier of IP/MPLS routers, having won 7 of the 12 packages announced so far. It was also selected as the 5G RAN supplier for a section of the Delhi–Mumbai railway corridor under a Kavach pilot project. Further, the company received expansion orders for DWDM and GPON OLT equipment from leading private telecom operators in India, and won a DWDM backbone buildout order from a broadband ISP in Africa, along with a network transformation deal for its MPLS-TP products for a power sector customer in Southeast Asia. The company said its long-term outlook remains positive, supported by strong structural drivers and rapid technology transitions across the telecom and networking landscape. Growing adoption of AI applications is driving a sharp increase in data traffic, while continued expansion of 4G networks and fresh 5G deployments in emerging markets are creating sustained demand. Investments in AI data centres are also translating into significant connectivity requirements. The company is seeing increasing traction for its new products across India and international markets, with wireless solutions beginning to lead international engagements in regions such as Europe, Latin America and Africa. At the same time, adoption of its wireline products is rising among private telecom operators in India. The company is also scaling up its international wireless engagements through strategic partnerships with NEC and Rakuten, while recent strategic wins for its optical products in Europe, Africa and Asia are providing momentum for further international expansion. Arnob Roy, COO of Tejas Networks said, “In Q3 FY26, our revenue was driven largely by sale of Wireline products to India Pvt and International customers. During the quarter we engaged in multiple field trials for our Wireless products in India and International markets; commercial negotiations are expected to close in the coming months.” Sumit Dhingra, CFO said, “In Q3 FY26 we had a revenue of Rs 307 crore, a QoQ growth of 17%. We ended the quarter with an order book of Rs 1,329 crore. Our net debt was 3,349 crore compared to 3,738 crore in Q2 FY26 mainly due to lower working capital, partly offset by capex; gross debt of 3,885 crore and cash of 537 crore.” Tejas Networks designs and manufactures wireline and wireless networking products, with a focus on technology, innovation, and R&D. TNL carrier-class products are used by telecom service providers, utilities, governments, and defense networks in 75+ countries. Tejas Networks is a part of the Tata Group, with Panatone Finvest (a subsidiary of Tata Sons) being the majority shareholder.

TMW, a Delaware-incorporated company engaged in toll processing of flat-rolled metals, has developed and patented the EPS Gen 4 technology over the past 15 years. Under the agreement, Lloyds Engineering will receive a licence to use TMW’s patented technology, along with related technical support services, the company said. The agreement allows Lloyds Engineering to design, manufacture and sell EPS Gen 4 cells globally, excluding China, Macao, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and within a 350-mile radius of Red Bud, Illinois, US. The arrangement is structured as a licensing deal, with annual cash payments to be made as per the purchase agreement. Lloyds Engineering will be entitled to manufacture and sell an unlimited number of EPS cells, subject to payment of an agreed earn-out to TMW for a specified period. There is no share exchange involved, and the transaction does not qualify as a related-party transaction, with promoters having no interest in TMW, the company said. As part of the pact, TMW will provide ongoing design upgrades, technical and sales training, and access to marketing materials. The EPS Gen 4 technology offers a sustainable alternative to conventional acid-based steel pickling, eliminating the use of acid, ensuring zero effluent discharge, and using fully recyclable materials, thereby addressing key environmental concerns in steel surface treatment. Lloyds Engineering Works is engaged in the design, engineering, manufacturing, fabrication, supply, erection and commissioning of a wide range of mechanical, hydraulic and structural systems. Its portfolio includes process plant equipment, metallurgical and chemical plant machinery, marine loading and unloading arms, truck and wagon loading systems, columns, pressure vessels, dryers, boilers, power plant and steel plant equipment, along with the execution of turnkey and EPC projects. On a standalone basis, net profit of Lloyds Engineering Works rose 18.75% to Rs 33.19 crore while net sales rose 14.99% to Rs 243.95 crore in Q2 September 2025 over Q2 September 2024. Shares of Lloyds Engineering Works shed 0.16% to Rs 50.91 on the BSE.

    <description><![CDATA[GIFT Nifty: GIFT Nifty January 2026 futures were down 53.50 points, indicating a negative opening for the Nifty 50 today.

GIFT Nifty: GIFT Nifty January 2026 futures were down 53.50 points, indicating a negative opening for the Nifty 50 today. Institutional Flows: Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) sold shares worth Rs 3,769.31 crore, while domestic institutional investors (DIIs) were net buyers to the tune of Rs 5,595.84 crore in the Indian equity market on 08 January 2026, provisional data showed. The FIIs had sold shares worth Rs 8,419.70 so far in January. This follows their cash sales of Rs 34,349.62 crore in December and Rs 17,500.31 crore in November. Global Markets: Asia market rose on Monday following Wall Street gains from last week after a U.S. job report showed that unemployment rate fell, signaling resilience in the labor market. Japanese markets were closed for a holiday. Investors will be keeping an eye on oil prices as Iran entered a third week of protests, which have reportedly seen more than 500 people killed. President Donald Trump is weighing options for intervention in Iran, media reports said. On Sunday, Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s coalition partner, Hirofumi Yoshimura, said that she may call an early general election. His comments come after domestic media reported that Takaichi was considering a snap election in February, citing government sources. On Friday stateside, the S&P 500 rose to new highs on Friday, notching a weekly gain, following the release of the latest jobs report. The broad market index closed up 0.65% to 6,966.28, a fresh record close. It also notched a new all-time intraday high in the session. The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.81% to 23,671.35. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 237.96 points, or 0.48%, to end at 49,504.07, scoring a new closing record as well. The December jobs report showed nonfarm payrolls increasing by 50,000 last month, less than the 73,000 estimate that was widely reported in the media. That data, though slightly weaker than expected, showed a U.S. economy that’s still trudging along, with investors anticipating that growth will ramp up. The unemployment rate inched down to 4.4%, while widely circulated media reports had provided a forecast of 4.5%. Traders took that as a sign that improvement in the economy would happen soon. Domestic Market: Key equity benchmarks ended sharply lower for a fifth straight session on Friday, with the Nifty closing below 25,700, as investor caution intensified ahead of a US Supreme Court ruling on the legality of American tariffs. An early attempt at a rebound quickly fizzled, with indices turning decisively lower within minutes of the open. Sentiment also remained under pressure amid sustained foreign institutional investor selling, weak global cues and firm crude oil prices. Auto and consumer durables stocks led the decline, while energy, IT and PSU bank shares bucked the trend and closed higher. The S&P BSE Sensex tumbled 604.72 points or 0.72% to 83,576.24. The Nifty 50 index dropped 193.55 points or 0.75% to 25,683.30. In five consecutive trading sessions, the Sensex declined 2.54% while the Nifty fell 2.45%.
