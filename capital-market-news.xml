Reserve Bank of India (RBI) released the data on performance of the private corporate business sector during the third quarter of 2025-26, drawn from abridged quarterly financial results of 3,188 listed non-government non-financial companies. At aggregate level, listed private non-financial companies recorded a double-digit sales growth of 10.1 per cent (y-o-y) during Q3:2025-26, after recording single digit growth in previous eleven quarters. This acceleration was mainly led by substantial improvement in sales growth of manufacturing sector. Sales of 1,794 listed private manufacturing companies expanded by 11.4 per cent (y-o-y) during Q3:2025-26, up from 8.5 per cent in the previous quarter, mainly driven by higher sales growth in automobiles, electrical machinery and non-ferrous metals industries. Sales growth of Information Technology (IT) companies continued to improve further to 8.8 per cent (y-o-y) during Q3:2025-26 from 7.8 per cent in the previous quarter. On the other hand, sales growth of non-IT services companies remained stable at 10.6 per cent in Q3:2025-26 from the previous quarter. Raw material expenses of manufacturing companies rose by 12.7 per cent (y-o-y) during Q3:2025-26 in line with the higher sales growth; raw material to sales ratio also inched up to 57.5 per cent during Q3 from 55.9 per cent in the previous quarter, pointing to input cost pressure. Operating profit of manufacturing companies increased by 11.8 per cent (y-o-y) during Q3, supported by moderate rise in other operating expenses. IT companies’ operating profit growth improved to 11.1 per cent, while it moderated to 4.0 per cent for non-IT services companies during Q3. Operating profit margin of manufacturing companies moderated sequentially during Q3:2025-26, while it improved for services sector companies. With the sequential decline in interest expenses, manufacturing companies’ interest coverage ratio (ICR) improved to 9.0 in Q3:2025-26 from 8.6 in Q2.

    <description><![CDATA[The Indian rupee ended the day almost flat on Wednesday amid tepid moves against the dollar.

The Indian rupee ended the day almost flat on Wednesday amid tepid moves against the dollar. Rupee stayed range-bound for the second consecutive day and settled 1 paisa lower at 90.96 (provisional) against the US dollar amid higher global crude oil prices and foreign fund outflows. A weaker greenback and positive sentiments in domestic equity markets prevented the rupee's losses. The benchmark ended the session up 50.15 points, or 0.06 percent, at 82,276.07, after having surged to a high of 82,957.91 earlier on the back of firm cues from global markets as new U.S. tariffs came into effect at 10 percent under a different legal framework. The broader NSE Nifty index hit an intraday high of 25,652.60 before closing up 57.85 points. At the interbank foreign exchange, the rupee opened at 90.94 against the greenback and traded in a narrow range through the session before settling at 90.96 (provisional), down 1 paisa from its previous close.

    <description><![CDATA[The Indian equity benchmarks managed to claw back some ground on Wednesday, ending marginally in the green after a highly volatile session.

The Indian equity benchmarks managed to claw back some ground on Wednesday, ending marginally in the green after a highly volatile session. The Sensex finished with a slight gain of 50.15 points or 0.06% to settle at 82,276.07, while the Nifty 50 advanced 57.70 points or (0.23%) to close at 25,482.35. The day began with a strong relief rally, with the Sensex surging 732 points in morning trade as global market nerves eased following a 10% universal tariff implementation in the U.S., which was less severe than the 15% rate previously feared. However, the indices surrendered most of these intraday gains due to heavy profit booking and persistent selling in heavyweights like Reliance Industries (down 2.23%) and State Bank of India (down 1.93%). The recovery was primarily spearheaded by the Nifty Metal index, which soared on the back of strong performances from Tata Steel (up 2.43%) and National Aluminium Company (up 5.22%). The IT sector, which had faced a brutal "Claude Code" rout in the previous session, staged a partial rebound, buoyed by value buying in Infosys (up 1.08%) and TCS (up 2.14%). Despite the positive close for the benchmarks, the broader market sentiment remained mixed as sectors such as FMCG, PSU Banks, and Realty ended in the red. Investors remained cautious ahead of the upcoming February 27th GDP data release, even as volatility, measured by the India VIX, cooled by nearly 5% to reflect a temporary stabilization in market sentiment. The broader market outperformed the frontline indices. The S&P BSE Mid-Cap index rallied 0.67% and the S&P BSE Small-Cap index added 0.48%. The market breadth was negative. The NSE's India VIX, a gauge of the market's expectation of volatility over the near term, dropped 4.68% to 13.49. Among the sectoral indices, the Metal index (up 2.70%), the Nifty Pharma index (up 1.85%) and the Nifty Auto index (up 1.85%) outperformed the Nifty 50 index. Meanwhile, the Nifty PSU Bank index (down 0.39%), the Nifty FMCG index (down 0.25%) and the Nifty Realty index (down 0.19%) underperformed the Nifty 50 index. Numbers to Track: The yield on India's 10-year benchmark federal paper rose 0.08% to 6.693 compared with the previous session close of 6.685. In the foreign exchange market, the rupee edged higher against the dollar. The partially convertible rupee was hovering at 90.8800 compared with its close of 90.9350 during the previous trading session. MCX Gold futures for 2 April 2026 settlement rose 0.71% to Rs 161,110. The US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the greenback's value against a basket of currencies, was down 0.05% to 97.85. The United States 10-year bond yield rose 0.57% to 4.056. In the commodities market, Brent crude for April 2026 settlement added 23 cents or 0.32% to $71 a barrel. Global Markets: The US Dow Jones index futures are currently up 65 points, indicating a positive opening for equities on Wall Street today. European markets trended higher on Wednesday as global investor anxiety subsided following the implementation of U.S. President Donald Trump’s universal tariff. Market nerves were notably soothed by the fact that the administration settled on a 10% rate, a more moderate figure compared to the previously threatened 15% levy. Meanwhile in Asia, most markets ended higher on Wednesday following a tech-driven rally on Wall Street that was fueled by easing concerns over artificial intelligence-led disruption in select industries. Overnight on Wall Street, U.S. equities rose on Tuesday, led by gains in Advanced Micro Devices and software stocks, as investors’ fears around artificial intelligence disruption to certain industries eased. The S&P 500 advanced 0.77% to close at 6,890.07, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.04% and settled at 22,863.68. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 370.44 points, or 0.76%, and ended at 49,174.50. Shares of AMD jumped 8.8% after Meta Platforms announced a multiyear deal with the semiconductor company. The new partnership entails deploying up to 6 gigawatts of AMD’s graphics processing units for AI data centers. Meta will also invest in AMD through a performance-based warrant for up to 160 million shares of the chipmaker. Stocks in Spotlight: Larsen & Toubro (L&T) added 0.88%. The company said its Power Transmission & Distribution (PT&D) vertical has secured ‘major’ EPC orders to establish electricity grid system elements in India and overseas. Coforge rose 0.51%.

The agreement builds upon decades of expertise at Warwick Manufacturing Group (WMG)—one of the University’s largest academic departments—and its School of Engineering. The University also announced a renewed focus on energy systems to support the partnership. Professor Stuart Croft, Vice-Chancellor and President of the University of Warwick, said, “We strive to make a better world through our world-leading research and education.

Our vision is to empower a billion lives through sustainable, affordable, and innovative energy solutions, and we are making strong progress toward that goal. This agreement with the University of Warwick—an institution with a distinguished track record in electrification and sustainability—will further accelerate our ambitions and strengthen the pathway to achieving them.” Professor Kerry Kirwan, Dean of WMG, said, “Applying excellent research to deliver industrial and societal impact has been part of WMG’s mission for the past 45 years. Our celebrated partnership with the Tata Group stretches back decades and continues to deliver positive global impact across research, education, and innovation.” Professor David Greenwood, Director for Industrial Engagement and CEO of the High Value Manufacturing Catapult at WMG, added, “Research relationships with India, including Tata, have always been incredibly valuable to us. With the UK-India free trade agreement now in place, it is the ideal time to collaborate on critical challenges in energy, industry, and the environment while exploring new research, education, and engagement opportunities.” Professor David Towers, Head of the School of Engineering at the University of Warwick, said, “By applying AI-enabled modelling and control techniques, we are developing solutions that enhance system stability, resilience, and efficiency. Our research spans national, regional, and microgrid-scale infrastructures, integrating renewables—particularly wind—alongside energy storage and hydrogen technologies. We look forward to working with Tata Power to translate these capabilities into scalable, industrially relevant decarbonisation pathways.” Tata Power Company is a part of the Tata Group and primarily engaged in the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity.

    <description><![CDATA[The agency has also affirmed the company’s short-term rating at ‘ACUITE A1+’.

The agency has also affirmed the company’s short-term rating at ‘ACUITE A1+’. Acuité Ratings had previously placed the company’s rating on 'Rating Watch with Developing Implications' on account of impending asset monetisation transactions. Acuite notes that ABL has completed the monetization of 5 BOTs (build-operate-transfer) and 5 HAMs (hybrid annuity model) resulting in total proceeds of Rs 2817 crore. The proceeds have been utilized to provide an exit to SBI Macquarie, reduction in short term borrowings thereby strengthening the capital structure of the company, make payments to Viva Highways (VHL) to acquire stake in Jaora Nayagaon Toll Road Company (JNTCPL) and settle vendor payments to avail cash discounts. Hence, the rating has been removed from rating watch. The remaining monetization of 6 HAM assets are expected to be completed by Q1 FY27 with an inflow of Rs 1100 crore. the timely completion of this transaction will remain key monitorable factor. The rating reaffirmation reflects a steady scale of operations with comfortable order book albeit subdued operating performance. The company’s unexecuted order book remains robust at Rs.16,477 crore as of 06 February 2026, providing revenue visibility at 2.33x of FY25 revenue. The order book is well-diversified across roads, buildings, power and railways. Additionally, the company has established a subsidiary in Saudi Arabia to tap infrastructure opportunities in the Middle East. The rating further factors in moderation in the company’s financial risk profile due to decrease in debt protection metrics during FY25. The increase in debt has led to higher interest costs, while lower accruals have resulted in a decline in both interest coverage ratio (ICR) and debt service coverage ratio (DSCR). Despite this moderation, the company’s tangible net worth has increased, and gearing remained below unity in FY25. The working capital cycle remains intensive due to inherent nature of the business. Ashoka Buildcon undertakes engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contracts for the road, railways, buildings and power sector.
