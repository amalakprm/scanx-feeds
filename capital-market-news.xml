He further highlighted that there is a need to bridge the gap between the intent and the functioning. As political leaders, there is a need to make sure that the bureaucracy aligns with political power. He further discussed the importance of communicating challenges amongst the industry members, mentioning standardisation of data localisation norms across the US and Europe.

    <description><![CDATA[Total, revenue from operations rose 11.14% year-on-year to Rs 45,991 crore in the quarter ended 31 December 2025.

Total, revenue from operations rose 11.14% year-on-year to Rs 45,991 crore in the quarter ended 31 December 2025. Profit before tax stood at Rs 1,457 crore in Q3 FY26, rising 23.68% from Rs 1,178 crore reported in Q3 FY25. The company’s reported EBITDA stood at Rs 6,496 crore in Q3 FY26, marking a 16% increase compared to Rs 5,579 crore in Q3 FY25. The EBITDA margin improved significantly to 14.4% in Q3 FY26, up from 13.1% in the same quarter last year. Consolidated crude steel production stood at 7.48 million tonnes in Q3 FY26, up 6% year-on-year, driven by the ramp-up of the JVML–Vijayanagar project. However, production declined 5% quarter-on-quarter due to the shutdown of Blast Furnace-3 (BF-3) at Vijayanagar from End-September 2025 for capacity upgradation. Consolidated sales hit an all-time high of 7.64 million tonnes, marking a 14% YoY increase, supported by strong domestic demand. Domestic sales rose 10% YoY to 6.59 million tonnes, while exports jumped 53% YoY to 0.84 million tonnes, accounting for 11% of Indian operations’ sales in Q3 FY26. Retail sales volumes increased 12% YoY. Crude steel production at Indian operations stood at 7.28 million tonnes in the quarter, up 7% year-on-year. Capacity utilisation was around 93%, excluding Blast Furnace-3 (BF-3) at Vijayanagar, which is under shutdown, and 85% including BF-3 capacity. Steel sales during the quarter touched a record high of 7.42 million tonnes, marking a 14% YoY increase. The company also reduced steel product inventories by around 0.3 million tonnes during the period. During the quarter, Bhushan Power & Steel (BPSL) recorded crude steel production of 1.0 million tonnes and sales volume of 0.98 million tonnes. Revenue from operations stood at Rs 5,770 crore, while adjusted EBITDA was Rs 1,011 crore. Adjusted EBITDA declined 16% quarter-on-quarter, primarily due to lower realisations and higher coking coal costs. The company reported a profit after tax of around Rs 1,578 crore for the quarter. During the quarter, JSW Vijayanagar Metallics (JVML) reported crude steel production of 1.18 million tonnes, achieving rated capacity following the commissioning of all balance facilities in Q2 FY26. Sales volume stood at 1.23 million tonnes. Revenue from operations was Rs 6,099 crore, while adjusted EBITDA came in at Rs 921 crore. Adjusted EBITDA rose 47% quarter-on-quarter, driven primarily by higher volumes. The company reported a profit after tax of Rs 382 crore for the quarter. On its outlook, the global economy remains resilient, with the IMF marginally raising its 2026 growth forecast to 3.3%, in line with 2025. Growth continues to be supported by investments in AI and technology, particularly in North America and Asia, despite trade policy uncertainty and geopolitical risks. Supportive policies, easy financial conditions and rapid private-sector adaptation are aiding momentum. In the US, growth remains firm heading into CY26, driven by strong tech investments and resilient consumer spending, even as the labour market shows signs of cooling. Following 75 bps of rate cuts in 2025, further policy easing is expected, while the impact of tariffs on growth and inflation remains limited so far. The Eurozone is witnessing modest expansion led by services, while manufacturing remains weak. Policy rates are on hold, inflation is near target and growth expectations have been revised upward, with expansionary fiscal policies expected to support medium-term growth. China’s growth momentum softened in H2CY25 due to weak fixed asset investment and continued stress in real estate, though manufacturing and exports provided some support. Fiscal and monetary policy are expected to remain growth-supportive in 2026. India’s outlook remains strong, supported by GST rationalisation, accommodative monetary policy, benign inflation and sustained government capex. The NSO has projected FY26 GDP growth at 7.4%, with upward revisions by the RBI and IMF. Domestic demand remains healthy, aided by strong auto sales, firm rural indicators and improving private capex conditions. Recent progress on economic reforms and trade agreements is expected to strengthen India’s medium-term growth prospects and enhance resilience amid global uncertainties. JSW Steel said its board has approved the formation of a joint venture company for a land development project in Mumbai. The JV will be set up through Peddar Realty Ltd (PRL), a wholly owned subsidiary of JSW Steel, which will hold a 51% stake, along with JSW Realty Pvt Ltd (JSWRPL) and other partners. The proposed transaction qualifies as a related-party transaction and will be undertaken on an arm’s-length basis. JSWRPL, a promoter group entity, will have an interest in the JV to the extent of its shareholding. The JV will participate in a formal tender process to acquire an identified land parcel in Mumbai for the development of office and commercial spaces. The company said the project aligns with its expansion plans and will help meet future captive office and commercial space requirements. PRL will invest up to Rs 51 crore in the JV through cash consideration, acquiring a 51% controlling stake. The acquisition is expected to be completed on or before March 31, 2026, subject to mutual extension by JV partners. No governmental or regulatory approvals are required. The JV company will be incorporated in due course and will operate in the real estate sector. JSW Steel is the flagship business of the diversified, US$ 23 billion JSW Group. As one of India’s leading business houses, JSW Group also has interests in energy, infrastructure, cement, paints, realty, e-platforms, mobility, defence, sports, and venture capital. Shares of JSW Steel fell 1.31% to end at Rs 1,169.35 on the BSE.

    <description><![CDATA[Domestic equity benchmarks ended sharply lower on Friday, erasing early gains as persistent foreign institutional investor selling weighed heavily on sentiment and sparked a broad-based selloff in the latter half of the session.

Domestic equity benchmarks ended sharply lower on Friday, erasing early gains as persistent foreign institutional investor selling weighed heavily on sentiment and sparked a broad-based selloff in the latter half of the session. The Sensex and Nifty opened marginally higher, supported by positive cues from Asian markets and easing geopolitical concerns linked to Greenland. However, sentiment turned decisively weaker post noon, with aggressive profit-booking and sustained selling pressure dragging the indices into the red. The Nifty closed below the 25,050 level, with all NSE sectoral indices ending in the red. Realty and PSU bank stocks led the losses amid heavy selling pressure. Foreign fund outflows remained the key overhang, with FIIs extending their net selling streak to 13 consecutive sessions in January, a trend that has steadily dented market capitalisation and investor confidence. Pressure on domestic shares intensified as the Indian rupee slid to a fresh all-time low against the US dollar, amplifying risk aversion. A subdued earnings season added to the gloom, as weak December-quarter results from several heavyweight companies triggered sharp, stock-specific declines. Rising crude oil prices further stoked concerns over inflation and external balances, capping any recovery attempts. The focus is now shifting to the Union Budget, which will take place on February 1. The S&P BSE Sensex tumbled 769.67 points or 0.94% to 81,537.70. The Nifty 50 index lost 241.25 points or 0.95% to 25,048.65. The broader market underperformed the frontline indices. The S&P BSE Mid-Cap index dropped 1.56%, while the S&P BSE Small-Cap index fell 2.19%. The market breadth was weak. On the BSE, 1,321 shares rose and 2,887 shares fell. A total of 157 shares were unchanged. The NSE's India VIX, a gauge of the market's expectation of volatility over the near term, jumped 6.31% to 14.19. The rupee hit a fresh record low of 91.99 against the US dollar in intraday trade on Friday, pressured by weak global cues and persistent dollar demand. Indian stock market will remain shut on Monday, 26 January 2026, for Republic Day. World Economic Forum: In a surprise appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos, billionaire Elon Musk said artificial intelligence could become smarter than all of humanity combined within the next five years. India has emerged as a premier hub for artificial intelligence applications, leveraging its tech-positive population and strong software legacy to transition into a “full-on AI economy”, according to the World Economic Forum’s Cathy Li. “India is a fascinating market, particularly in terms of AI applications and services. It is a no-brainer to leverage these strengths, and the country is already using its strong building blocks to move toward a full-on AI economy,” she said. Numbers to Track: The yield on India's 10-year benchmark federal paper was up 0.27% to 6.654 as compared with the previous close of 6.636. In the foreign exchange market, the rupee edged lower against the dollar. The partially convertible rupee was hovering at 91.8950 compared with its close of 91.5800 during the previous trading session. MCX Gold futures for 5 February 2025 settlement gained 0.25% to Rs 1,56,769. The US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the greenback's value against a basket of currencies, was down 0.01% to 98.17. The United States 10-year bond yield declined 0.28% to 4.239. In the commodities market, Brent crude for March 2025 settlement gained 80 cents or 1.25% to $64.86 a barrel. Global Markets: Most European shares declined on Friday as investors digest events at Davos, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's excoriating speech about the continent. Asian indices ended higher, tracking Wall Street gains as geopolitical concerns eased. The Bank of Japan kept its key policy rate unchanged at 0.75% but raised Japan’s growth outlook ahead of the upcoming election. The central bank lifted its GDP growth forecast for FY26 to 0.9% from 0.7% and for FY27 to 1% from 0.7%, citing a moderate global recovery, rising wages and prices, supportive government measures, and accommodative financial conditions. Japan’s headline inflation rate in December slowed sharply to 2.1%, its lowest level since March 2022. Its core inflation rate came in at 2.4% on the year. Some tech stocks in Asia fell after shares of California-based Intel plummeted 13% in after-hours U.S. trading on its soft guidance for the current quarter, despite posting fourth-quarter earnings beats Thursday. Overnight in the U.S., the main benchmarks extended their gains from the previous session after Greenland tensions eased. The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 306.78 points, or 0.63%, and closed at 49,384.01. The 30-stock index recovered from the losses seen earlier this week following President Donald Trump’s new Europe tariffs announcement. The S&P 500 climbed 0.55% and ended at 6,913.35. The Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.91% and settled at 23,436.02, supported by gains in Nvidia, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms. Stocks in Spotlight: Adani Group stocks came under heavy selling pressure on Friday after media reports said the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has sought court approval to directly email summons to Gautam Adani and Sagar Adani, citing court filings. The development triggered sharp declines across the conglomerate’s listed entities as investors reacted to the regulatory overhang. Shares of Adani Green Energy plunged 14.63%, while Adani Energy Solutions fell 11.97%. Adani Enterprises dropped 10.76% and Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone slid 7.52%. Adani Total Gas declined 5.71%, while Adani Power lost 5.50%.

The Indian rupee hit an all-time low of 92 on Friday and recovered marginally to settle at 91.88 (provisional) against the American currency, amid selling pressure from foreign funds and risk-off sentiment in global markets. The domestic currency gave up early gains and hit a record low of 92.005 per US dollar in intraday trade due to weak domestic markets and persistent foreign fund outflows. Moreover, gains in crude oil prices and a surge in US treasury yields weighed on the rupee. At the interbank foreign exchange, the rupee opened at 91.45 and then gained ground to touch an intraday high of 91.41 against the greenback. It touched an all-time intraday low of 92.00 before settling for the day at a record closing low of 91.88 (provisional), down 30 paise from its previous closing level. The benchmark BSE Sensex ended down 769.67 points, or 0.94 percent, at 81,537.70 while the broader NSE Nifty index slumped 241.25 points, or 0.95 percent, to 25,048.65.

    <description><![CDATA[Indian equities enter the late-January week under pronounced volatility and mixed global cues.

Indian equities enter the late-January week under pronounced volatility and mixed global cues. Domestic benchmarks endured deep corrections mid-week, with persistent foreign institutional investor (FII) outflows and a weakening rupee denting sentiment, even as occasional value buying surfaced. While the broader market struggled, key defensive and sectoral themes provided intermittent support. Globally, the easing of geopolitical tensions, particularly softened tariff rhetoric from the U.S., helped rebound risk assets in Asia and supported a recovery in select Indian stocks later in the week. However, uncertainty around trade policies and mixed earnings reports kept investors cautious. With the Union Budget looming and rate expectations in focus, would continue to closely monitor macro indicators and global risk sentiment. In India, the Industrial Production for the month of December 2025 would be announced on Wednesday (28 January 2026). The industrial production in India grew 6.7% from the previous year in November of 2025, accelerating from the upwardly revised 0.5% increase in the previous month, to mark the sharpest pace of expansion since October of 2023. On Friday (30 January 2026), the government budget value for the period ended in December would be made public. India’s fiscal deficit widened to Rs 9.77 trillion in April–November 2025–26, up from Rs 8.47 trillion a year earlier, reaching 62.3% of the government’s full-year target compared with 52.5% in the same period last year. Total receipts rose 2.9% year-on-year to INR 19.49 trillion (55.7% of the annual target) while total expenditure increased 6.7% to Rs 29.26 trillion (57.8% of the full-year target). Lastly, the foreign exchange reserves position for the week ended on January 23 would be unveiled on the same day. The foreign exchange reserves in India increased to $687,190 million in January 9 from $686,800 million in the previous week. In China, Industrial Profits (YTD) data for the period ended in December 2025 would be released in Tuesday (27 January 2026). The profits at China’s industrial firms edged up 0.1% yoy to CNY 6.63 trillion in January–November 2025, notably easing from a 1.9% increase in the first ten months but still marking a fourth consecutive gain since August. In the United States, the Dallas Fed Manufacturing Index data for the month of January would be announced on Monday (26 January 2026). The Dallas Fed’s general business activity index for Texas manufacturing fell 0.5 points to (-10.9) in December 2025, its lowest level since June, while the outlook index sank deeper into negative territory at (-11.9), indicating a deterioration in perceptions of broader business conditions. On Tuesday (27 January 2026), the ADP Employment Change Weekly figures would be made public. The US private employers added an average of 8,000 jobs per week in the four weeks ending December 27, 2025, down from an average gain of 11,250 in the previous period, according to ADP Research. On Wednesday, the API Crude Oil Stock Change for the week ended on January 23 would be unveiled. US crude oil inventories rose by 3.04 million barrels in the week ended 16 January 2025, building on a 5.3 million-barrel increase in the prior week. On Thursday (29 January 2026), the US Federal Reserve will announce its latest monetary policy decision. The minutes from the Fed's December meeting noted that most of the FOMC judged that rate cuts are likely to be appropriate next year if inflation eases over time. Still, policymakers were divided in their assessment of risks between higher inflation and unemployment, with a part of the FOMC displaying greater concern that inflation becoming entrenched may require higher borrowing costs, while others preferred a greater magnitude of rate cuts to curb signs of a softening labor market. Further, the US Balance of Trade figures for November 2025 would be released on the same day. The US trade deficit narrowed sharply to $29.4 billion in October 2025, the smallest gap since June 2009, down from a revised $48.1 billion in September. On Friday (30 January 2026), the Producer Price Index for the month of December 2025 would be made public. The US producer prices rose 0.2% month over month in November 2025, accelerating from a 0.1% increase in October, according to delayed data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

    <description><![CDATA[Market chatter centred on the PIDF scheme, which was extended until December 2025 and is used to incentivise the deployment of digital payment infrastructure.

Market chatter centred on the PIDF scheme, which was extended until December 2025 and is used to incentivise the deployment of digital payment infrastructure. There is currently no clarity on whether the scheme will be extended beyond that date. The media report said PIDF incentives contribute about 20% of Paytm's operating profit. This raised concerns over a potential earnings impact for digital payments and infrastructure players. However, there has been no official communication from the Reserve Bank of India on any extension or replacement of the scheme. In response, Paytm clarified to the bourses today (23 January 2026) that it has recognised incentives under the PIDF scheme in line with RBI guidelines. The company said the incentives relate to qualifying expenditure incurred towards the deployment of payment acceptance devices such as soundboxes and EDC machines, primarily across Tier-3 to Tier-6 centres and select regions of India. The company said the PIDF scheme was valid until 31 December 2025, and incentives received under the scheme amounted to Rs 128 crore for the six months ended 30 September 2025. Paytm added that there has been no announcement so far on any extension or replacement of the scheme. In the event the scheme is not extended, the company said it expects the impact to be significantly offset over time through higher revenues and more targeted sales efforts. It also said it will make appropriate disclosures to the stock exchanges in accordance with applicable regulations. Paytm is India's leading mobile payments and financial services distribution company. The company posted a consolidated net profit of Rs 21 crore in Q2 FY26, significantly lower than the Rs 930 crore reported in Q2 FY25. Revenue from operations rose 24% year-on-year to Rs 2,061 crore.
