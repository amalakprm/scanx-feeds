Reserve Bank of India (RBI) stated in its latest monthly update that based on the Consumer Price Inflation (CPI) 2024 base year series, headline inflation stood at 2.8 per cent (y-o-y) in January. CPI food, fuel and core (CPI excluding food and fuel) inflation were 2.1 per cent, 0.4 per cent and 3.4 per cent, respectively. Excluding precious metals, core inflation was lower at 1.9 per cent, indicating that underlying price pressures remain relatively contained. Core inflation accounted for the bulk of headline inflation in January, followed by food and fuel. The central bank stated that near-term economic outlook remains favourable and is well-positioned to sustain its high growth momentum, driven by consumption, investment, and productivity-enhancing reforms. Inflation is expected to remain benign and near the inflation target, providing a positive growth inflation balance in the near term.

    <description><![CDATA[Reserve Bank of India (RBI) stated in its latest monthly update that overall financial conditions exhibited some tightness from the second half of January till February so far (up to 17th) driven by relative tightening in the corporate bond market.

Reserve Bank of India (RBI) stated in its latest monthly update that overall financial conditions exhibited some tightness from the second half of January till February so far (up to 17th) driven by relative tightening in the corporate bond market. From a relatively mild surplus in the second half of January, system liquidity rose towards the end of the month and into February. This rise was primarily induced by the accelerated government spending and a series of liquidity-augmenting measures by the RBI. The Reserve Bank conducted six variable-rate repo (VRR) auctions in the second half of January to address the transient liquidity tightness. The Reserve Bank also conducted open market operations (OMOs) purchase auctions amounting to Rs 1.5 lakh crore and 3-year USD/INR Buy/Sell Swap auction of USD 10 billion. 30 Bolstered by adequate liquidity, average net absorption under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) increased during January 16, 2026- February 17, 2026, from the preceding one-month period, with banks’ availment of the standing deposit facility (SDF) registering a sharp increase. Marginal standing facility (MSF) usage remained broadly stable, suggesting that day-to-day liquidity mismatches were minimal and well-managed.

Reserve Bank of India (RBI) stated in its latest monthly update that economic activity continued to be resilient in January, as evidenced by high-frequency indicators of energy consumption, digital payments, trade and logistics. E-way bills continued to exhibit double- digit growth supported by GST rate rationalisation. Electricity demand sustained its robust growth, primarily due to higher demand on account of the cold wave conditions across northern and eastern regions of the country, as well as from sustained industrial activity. GST revenue growth held steady. Petroleum consumption growth remained resilient, notwithstanding the deceleration. Digital payments registered steady growth in both transaction value and volume. Toll collections in January continued with the declining trend, observed post the introduction of the FASTag Annual Pass scheme in August 2025. RBI noted that overall demand conditions remained upbeat in January. Rural demand strengthened further with retail sales of two-wheelers and tractors witnessing a pick-up in growth, supported by post-GST momentum and healthy rural cash flows from the kharif harvest and wedding seasons. Retail passenger vehicle sales continued to expand in January, albeit at a slower pace. The sales slowdown reflects normalisation of markets following a period of high demand triggered by GST rate rationalisation. Domestic air passenger traffic recovered after the slump in December caused by the disruption in flight schedules.

Reserve Bank of India (RBI) stated in its latest monthly update that economic activity continued to be resilient in January, underpinned by upbeat demand conditions. Quarterly results of listed private companies show strengthening aggregate sales growth. Industrial activity remained strong, and services sector sustained its healthy growth. The Union Budget 2026- 27 reaffirmed Government’s commitment to fiscal consolidation without diluting the focus on long-term growth with stepped up allocation towards capital expenditure. The Union Government also accepted most of the recommendations of the 16th Finance Commission, thereby opting for a new formula for horizontal devolution of funds recognising the contribution of states to India’s growth. By adhering to a credible path of fiscal consolidation, maintaining a strong thrust on capital expenditure, and prioritising infrastructure, innovation, and human capital development, the Government has reinforced the foundations for long-term growth.

The Indian rupee plunged 31 paise to settle at 90.99 (provisional) against the US dollar on Friday, tracking a strong American currency against major currencies and higher crude oil prices amid intensifying US-Iran tensions. Positive momentum in domestic equity markets failed to support the Indian unit. Indian shares bounced back on Friday after falling sharply in the previous session on rising geopolitical tensions and uncertainty over the Federal Reserve's rate path. The benchmark BSE Sensex jumped 316.57 points, or 0.38 percent, to 82,814.71. The broader NSE Nifty index surged 116.90 points, or 0.46 percent, to 25,571.25, with metal and banking stocks leading the surge.

    <description><![CDATA[Indian equities head into the next trading week in a mixed and volatile mood, with recent sessions marked by sharp intra-week swings.

Indian equities head into the next trading week in a mixed and volatile mood, with recent sessions marked by sharp intra-week swings. Sectoral divergence continued to widen. Banking and capital goods stocks provided support, while IT names remained under pressure, highlighting ongoing rotation within the market. While India's industrial momentum remains healthy, with IIP growing 7.8% in December, the global "risk-off" sentiment is currently the primary driver. Further, the latest U.S. Fed minutes revealed a hawkish tilt despite inflation cooling to 2.4% in January. Conversely, China’s industrial output grew 5.3% in December, offering a sliver of macroeconomic stability. Given elevated volatility and mixed global cues, the focus could remain on large-caps and earnings-visible themes, as investors continue to closely track currency trends and global risk sentiment for clearer direction. In India, the M3 Money Supply figures for the fortnight ended on February 14 would be made public on Wednesday (25 February 2026). Money Supply M3 in India increased to Rs 32,10,541 crore in the fortnight ended on January 31 from Rs 27,91,395 crore two weeks before. On Friday (27 February 2026), the GDP growth rate for the quarter ended on December would be announced. The Indian gross domestic product expanded by 8.2% in the September quarter of 2025 as compared with the previous year. It was the sharpest annual growth rate since the March quarter of 2024, reflecting the resilience of the Indian economy to the 50% tariffs from the United States that were passed in August, aided by an increase in government spending and GST tax cuts to support consumer confidence and private investment. The Government Budget Value for the period ended in January 2026 would be released. India’s fiscal deficit narrowed to Rs 8.56 trillion in April–December 2025–26, down from Rs 9.14 trillion a year earlier, reaching 54.5% of the government’s full-year target compared with 56.7% in the same period last year. Lastly, the Infrastructure Output for the month of January would also be unveiled on Friday. The infrastructure output in India rose by 3.7% from the previous year in December of 2025, accelerating from the upwardly revised 2.1% increase in the previous month to mark the sharpest pace of growth since the 15-month high from August. In China, the one-year and the five-year loan prime rate would be announced on Tuesday (24 February 2026). The People’s Bank of China (PBoC) kept key lending rates at record lows for an eighth consecutive month in January. The one-year loan prime rate (LPR) remained at 3.0%, while the five-year LPR was unchanged at 3.5%. The year-to-date (YTD) FDI for the period ended in January would also be released on the same day. The foreign direct investment (FDI) into China fell 9.5% to CNY 747.77 billion in 2025, following a sharp 24.7% decline in 2024 and marking the third consecutive year of contraction. In the United States, the Dallas Fed Manufacturing Index for the month of February would be announced on Monday (23 February 2026). The Dallas Fed’s general business activity index for Texas manufacturing increased 10 points to (-1.2) in January 2026, reversing from December’s contraction value of (-11.3). The outlook index rebounded into positive territory at 2.9, indicating an improvement in perceptions of broader business conditions. On Tuesday (24 February 2026), the ADP Employment Change Weekly figures would be announced. US private employers added an average of 10,250 jobs per week in the four weeks ending January 31, 2026, up from 7,750 in the previous period, according to ADP Research. The S&P/Case-Shiller Home Price for the month of December 2024 would be announced on the same day. The Case-Shiller 20-City Home Price Index rose 1.4% year over year in November 2025, slightly above October’s 1.3% gain. On Wednesday (25 February 2026), the API Crude Oil Stock Change for the week ended on February 20 would be unveiled. US crude oil inventories fell by 0.61 million barrels in the week ended February 13th, 2026, slightly paring a 13.4 million-barrel surge in the prior week which marked the sharpest increase since January 2023. On Thursday (26 February 2026), the Initial Jobless Claims data for the period ended on February 21 would be released. The initial jobless claims in the US fell by 23,000 from the previous week to 206,000 on the second week of February to swing back to levels that are well below the average through the start of last year. On Friday (27 February 2026), the Producer Price Inflation figures for January 2026 would be unveiled. The US producer prices rose 0.5% month-on-month in December 2025, the largest gain in three months, accelerating from a 0.2% increase in November.

    <description><![CDATA[The Indian equity markets staged a resilient recovery on Friday, February 20, 2026, recouping a portion of the previous session's steep losses.

The Indian equity markets staged a resilient recovery on Friday, February 20, 2026, recouping a portion of the previous session's steep losses. The Sensex climbed 316.57 points while the Nifty 50 managed to close above the crucial 25,550 mark. Despite a cautious start triggered by escalating U.S.-Iran tensions and high crude oil prices, broad-based buying in heavyweights like Hindalco, NTPC and L&T, supported by positive news from the India AI Impact Summit, offset continued weakness in the IT sector, allowing both benchmark indices to end the week with marginal gains. The barometer index, the S&P BSE Sensex rose 0.38% to settle at 82,814.71. The Nifty 50 index rose 116.90 points or 0.46% to close at 25,571.25. Hindalco Industries (up 3.21%), NTPC (up 2.64%) and Larsen & Toubro (up 2.33%) boosted the Nifty higher today.

I keep talking about the limitless potential between our two nations, and I truly mean it. From the trade deal to Pax Silica to defence cooperation, the potential for our two nations to work together is truly limitless. I aim to fulfill that over the next three years that I’m here.” Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis spoke at the India AI Impact Summit, highlighting the state’s achievements in technology.

The HCOB Eurozone Composite PMI rose to 51.9 in February, the strongest since November, driven by gains in manufacturing and services, though new orders remained soft and input costs accelerated. Asian markets ended mixed, after all three major Wall Street indexes declined overnight, pressured by a drop in private credit stocks and Iran-U.S. tensions. Prospects of a strike on Iran have risen with U.S. President Donald Trump reportedly saying that he would take a call to decide on military action against Tehran in the next 10 days. This pushed Brent Crude higher, gaining 0.26%, to settle at $71.92. In Asia, investors assessed Japan's latest inflation data.

The core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food prices, eased to 2%, the lowest level since January 2024. It was down from 2.4% in December. As per reports, despite the slowdown in headline inflation, the Bank of Japan is unlikely to delay rate hikes as fresh-food prices remain volatile, while energy costs fell after Japan scrapped its fuel tax in December.

Shares of Blue Owl dropped about 6%, while Blackstone and Apollo Global Management each fell more than 5%. Software stocks also remained under pressure amid persistent worries about artificial intelligence disruption. The sector has struggled in recent weeks as investors assess how AI could reshape enterprise software demand. Stocks in Spotlight: Shares of Novartis India hit an upper circuit of 20%.

Pax Silica is the US Department of State's flagship effort on AI and supply chain security, advancing new economic security consensus among allies and trusted partners.

    <description><![CDATA[Indian equity benchmarks ended the week with moderate gains.

Indian equity benchmarks ended the week with moderate gains. The Sensex and Nifty gained in four out of five trading sessions. Market sentiment remained positive as investors responded favorably to the AI summit held in India, overshadowing weak economic data and global cues. During the week, key economic data releases from the UK, the US, and India were closely tracked, which are likely to influence the market’s growth trajectory in the coming sessions. Market participants will monitor crude oil prices, movements in gold and silver prices, upcoming initial public offers (IPOs) and broader global cues for further direction.

Over the three consecutive sessions, Sensex and Nifty jumped 1.34% and 1.37%, respectively. In a dramatic reversal of recent gains, the Indian benchmark indices experienced a severe broad-based sell-off on Thursday. The crash was triggered by several factors, including escalating geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and Iran and a sharp spike in global crude oil prices. Additionally, deep-seated uncertainty regarding the U.S. Federal Reserve's interest rate trajectory weighed on sentiment following its latest meeting minutes.

In Asia, investors assessed Japan's latest inflation data. The island nation's headline inflation rate fell from 2.1% in December to 1.5% in January, its lowest level since March 2022. The reading ended a run of 45 straight months in which inflation had remained above the Bank of Japan’s 2% target. The core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food prices, eased to 2%, the lowest level since January 2024. It was down from 2.4% in December. As per reports, despite the slowdown in headline inflation, the Bank of Japan is unlikely to delay rate hikes as fresh-food prices remain volatile, while energy costs fell after Japan scrapped its fuel tax in December. Japan’s manufacturing activity improved in February, with the S&P Global Japan Manufacturing PMI rising to 52.8 from 51.5 in January, marking the strongest expansion since May 2022. Growth was supported by firm domestic and overseas demand, with export orders rising at the fastest pace in eight years. While hiring growth eased from January’s peak, it remained solid. Input costs increased at a slightly faster pace. Manufacturers stayed optimistic about the year-ahead outlook, backed by stronger demand, semiconductor and AI-related orders, and ongoing product launches. Overnight on Wall Street, the US stocks closed lower on Thursday, pulling the S&P 500 close to flat for the year, as investors rotated out of financials and monitored escalating tensions between the US and Iran. Reflecting a surge in imports and a slump in exports, the Commerce Department released a report on Thursday showing the U.S. trade deficit unexpectedly widened in the month of December. The Commerce Department said the trade deficit grew to $70.3 billion in December from a revised $53.0 billion in November. The unexpectedly wider trade deficit partly reflected a continued surge in the value of imports, which shot up by 3.6 percent to $357.6 billion in December after spiking by 4.2 percent to $345.3 billion in November. The report also showed a continued slump in the value of exports, which tumbled by 1.7 percent to $287.3 billion in December after plunging by 3.4 percent to $292.3 billion in November. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 267.50 points, or 0.54%, closing at 49,395.16. The S&P 500 declined 0.28%, ending at 6,861.89, while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.31% to 22,682.73. Financial stocks led the decline after Blue Owl Capital said it would tighten investor liquidity following the sale of $1.4 billion in loan assets, raising concerns about potential losses in the private credit market. Shares of Blue Owl dropped about 6%, while Blackstone and Apollo Global Management each fell more than 5%. Software stocks also remained under pressure amid persistent worries about artificial intelligence disruption. The sector has struggled in recent weeks as investors assess how AI could reshape enterprise software demand.
