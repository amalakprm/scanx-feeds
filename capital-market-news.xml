    <description><![CDATA[Pound slumped by over half a percent against dollar on Thursday to its lowest level in two weeks ahead of Bank of England’s interest rate decision.

Pound slumped by over half a percent against dollar on Thursday to its lowest level in two weeks ahead of Bank of England’s interest rate decision. Broad strength in the greenback is adding pressure on the GBP/USD counter that is currently quoting at $1.3584, down 0.57% on the day. Trump’s pick of hawkish Fed chair is also seen capping gains in the basket currencies. The counter is abating from 4-year high levels attained last week. The dollar index is holding at 97.70, up 0.20% on the day. Investors will now focus on US JOLTS Job Openings data for December and Fed speakers for further cues. ECB monetary policy announcement is also slated for later in the day. On the NSE, GBP/INR futures are down more than 1% at 122.75.

Net cash stood at Rs 1,556 crore as of 31st December 2025 Girish Tanti, vice chairman, Suzlon Group, said, “We have initiated Suzlon 2.0, a comprehensive business transformation strategy aimed at establishing ourselves as a full-stack clean energy solutions conglomerate. This strategic shift broadens our scope across wind, solar, storage, and emerging clean energy technologies, enabling us to offer integrated solutions to our customers. Key growth priorities under Suzlon 2.0 include launching DevCo as a standalone FDRE project development vertical, transforming OMS into a digital-first platform, setting up smart manufacturing facilities, and capitalizing on global opportunities. Our recognition as one of the world's top 10 most sustainable companies underscores the success of this direction. As electric mobility gains traction, AI capacity expands, and industrial decarbonisation accelerates, the green transition is gaining significant momentum." JP Chalasani, chief executive officer, Suzlon Group, said, “Our closing order book of 6.4 GW stands higher than the opening orderbook for the quarter, despite the highest-ever deliveries in 30 years. This reflects the demand for our solutions and the effectiveness of our execution. Our balanced EPC strategy – targeting around 50% share of the EPC business by 2028 is progressing steadily, with the EPC share increasing from 20% to 27% this quarter. Our project development pipeline of 25+ GW is also complementing this strategy to augur growth for us. The success of this shift is enhancing revenue visibility, improving project control, and will continue to be a big growth driver for the group.” Rahul Jain, chief financial officer, Suzlon Group, said, “Q3 FY26 marks another milestone in Suzlon’s growth journey, with our highest-ever quarterly deliveries of 617 MW in India resulting in strong upswing across all financial metrics. Our performance in the first nine months — driven by 66% growth in deliveries, and a 77% increase in EBITDA — demonstrates the strength of our integrated business model and disciplined execution. Driven by strong fundamentals, rising C&I demand, and a market shift towards FDRE tenders, our accelerated execution ramp-up is translating into robust operating performance. As India’s wind sector accelerates, Suzlon’s end-to-end capabilities, competitive cost structure, and customer-centric approach position us uniquely to deliver sustainable value for all stakeholders.” The Suzlon Group is a leading global renewable energy solutions provider, with around 21.5 GW of wind energy capacity installed across 17 countries.

    <description><![CDATA[Revenue from operations jumped 291.27% to Rs 283.99 crore in Q3 FY26 as against Rs 72.58 crore in Q3 FY25.

Revenue from operations jumped 291.27% to Rs 283.99 crore in Q3 FY26 as against Rs 72.58 crore in Q3 FY25. Profit before tax were at Rs 74.34 crore in Q3 FY26, zoomed 240.69% as against Rs 21.82 crore in Q3 FY25. EBITDA gained 222.35% to Rs 79.3 crore in Q3 FY26, as against Rs 24.6 crore reported in Q3 FY25. The EBITDA margin reduced to 27.9% in Q3 FY26 as against 30.8% in Q3 FY25. Bharanidharan Pandyan, joint managing & whole-time director, said, “The global power transmission and grid equipment market continues to see steady investment driven by renewable integration, inter-regional transmission links and the need for grid stability. Utilities and large industrial networks are increasingly focusing on high-voltage and power quality solutions that improve network reliability and operating efficiency. In this environment, Quality Power continues to focus on technology-led offerings, export-oriented growth and deeper value chain participation across high-voltage systems.” The consolidated order book stands at approximately Rs 8,950 million, offering healthy revenue visibility across a diversified mix of product categories and geographies. The order pipeline reflects steady demand and supports execution-led growth over the near to medium term. On its Strategic Developments, the company completed the acquisition of a 50% equity stake in Sukrut Electric Company, resulting in a joint venture with Yash Highvoltage. Sukrut operates in the electrical equipment manufacturing space, including panels, instruments, and related assemblies, which is well aligned with the group’s core business segments. The partnership is expected to support product portfolio expansion, enable cross-supply opportunities, and enhance access to OEMs and utility customers. Post-acquisition, the company has nominated directors to Sukrut’s board to ensure governance oversight and operational alignment with group objectives. Meanwhile, the company’s manufacturing expansion and integration initiatives are progressing largely in line with planned schedules. The construction timeline for the Sangli plant has been advanced to June 2026 from the earlier target of September 2026. Capacity expansion at the Cochin facility has been completed and is now operational, while capacity enhancement at the Mehru Bhiwadi plant is progressing well, with full completion targeted by Q4 FY2026. In addition, the magnet-wire backward integration line remains under execution and is progressing in line with earlier guidance. Overall, these initiatives are aimed at reducing dependence on external suppliers for critical inputs, improving delivery timelines, and strengthening control over product quality and testing standards. On its outlook, demand for advanced transmission and grid-support equipment is expected to remain strong, supported by sustained investments in new transmission capacity and the upgradation of existing networks to enhance reliability and grid stability. Against this backdrop, the company continues to focus on disciplined project execution while expanding manufacturing capacity and strengthening its technology capabilities. These initiatives are likely to support sustainable growth over the medium term, although execution efficiency, input cost trends, and broader market conditions will remain key monitorables. Quality Power Electrical Equipments is engaged in the business of energy transition equipment and power technologies.

Gold slipped below the $5,000 per ounce mark in Asia on Thursday as profit-taking emerged after the metal’s sharp $300 surge in the previous session. The pullback was reinforced by a firmer US dollar, following cautious signals from the Federal Reserve on the pace of future rate cuts. The dollar index climbed above 97.6, hovering near a two-week high, after Fed Governor Lisa Cook highlighted lingering inflation risks and played down expectations of near-term policy easing. Broader attention also remained on upcoming ECB and BOE meetings, both expected to keep rates unchanged, while Japan’s weekend election continued to pressure the yen. On the domestic front, MCX April gold futures recovered from intraday lows and last traded near Rs 152,945 per 10 grams, down marginally on the day.

The US dollar index edged up above 97 mark today, adding to recent gains as the index moved up further from four-year low. Economic cues are stable. A report released by the Institute for Supply Management on Wednesday showed its reading on US service sector activity came in unchanged in the month of January. The ISM said its services PMI came in at 53.8 in January, unchanged from a revised reading in December. Risk aversion stayed in place as the tech-heavy Nasdaq slumped to its lowest closing level in over a month. This triggered some support for the US dollar index. The dollar index is currently trading at 97.60, down 0.15% on the day. This is the highest level in nearly two-weeks.
