    <description><![CDATA[Domestic equity benchmarks snapped a five-day losing streak on Monday after a sharp intraday rebound.

Domestic equity benchmarks snapped a five-day losing streak on Monday after a sharp intraday rebound. The move was driven by positive global cues, value buying and reassuring comments on India-US trade ties from newly appointed US Ambassador to India Sergio Gor. The Sensex, which was down over 700 points in early trade, recovered more than 1,000 points from the day’s low by the close. The Nifty also climbed back above the 25,790 level as sentiment improved, with metals, PSU banks and energy stocks leading the recovery. The market reacted after Gor said India and the US remain actively engaged on trade and that talks are continuing despite differences. He also conveyed greetings from President Donald Trump to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Sentiment received an added boost after Gor announced that India would be invited next month to join PaxSilica. The recovery was broad-based. Bank Nifty rebounded sharply, while midcap and smallcap indices erased a large part of their early losses. Export-oriented stocks also gained as fears of an immediate tariff escalation eased after weeks of sustained selling and foreign fund outflows. The S&P BSE Sensex advanced 301.93 points or 0.36% to 83,878.17. The Nifty 50 index gained 106.95 points or 0.42% to 25,790.25. In the past five consecutive trading sessions, the Sensex declined 2.54% while the Nifty fell 2.45%. State Bank of India (up 1.40%), ICICI Bank (up 1.12%) and Reliance Industries (up 0.59%) were major drags on the Nifty today. The broader market underperformed the frontline indices. The S&P BSE Mid-Cap index declined 0.41% and the S&P BSE Small-Cap index fell 0.68%. The market breadth was weak. On the BSE, 1,569 shares rose and 2,724 shares fell. A total of 192 shares were unchanged. The NSE's India VIX, a gauge of the market's expectation of volatility over the near term, rallied 4.05% to 11.37. Economy: India’s consumer inflation rose to 1.33% in December, accelerating from 0.71% in the prior month. The rise in consumer inflation was mainly driven by food prices, while fuel and light inflation rate eased in December. Numbers to Track: The yield on India's 10-year benchmark federal paper fell 0.48% to 6.604 as compared with the previous close of 6.636. In the foreign exchange market, the rupee edged higher against the dollar. The partially convertible rupee was hovering at 90.1700 compared with its close of 90.1800 during the previous trading session. MCX Gold futures for 5 February 2026 settlement added 1.91% to Rs 141,470. The US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the greenback's value against a basket of currencies, was down 0.29% to 98.84. The United States 10-year bond yield rose 0.72% to 4.202. In the commodities market, Brent crude for March 2026 settlement declined 32 cents or 0.51% to $63.02 a barrel.

The December jobs report showed nonfarm payrolls increasing by 50,000 last month, less than the 73,000 estimate that was widely reported in the media. That data, though slightly weaker than expected, showed a U.S. economy that’s still trudging along, with investors anticipating that growth will ramp up. The unemployment rate inched down to 4.4%, while widely circulated media reports had provided a forecast of 4.5%. Traders took that as a sign that improvement in the economy would happen soon.

WTI crude futures hovered around $59 per barrel on Monday, extending last week’s gains as geopolitical tensions continued to underpin prices. Escalating protests in Iran, now in their third week, have heightened concerns over potential supply disruptions, with authorities signaling a tougher response and sharp rhetoric exchanged between Tehran and Washington. Uncertainty also lingered over Venezuela’s crude exports as shifting US policy and sanctions clouded the outlook, while President Donald Trump warned Cuba of possible cuts to Venezuelan oil and financial support. Adding support, a softer US dollar lifted dollar-denominated assets, with the dollar index easing to around 98.5.

The move was driven by strong safe-haven demand amid rising geopolitical tensions between the US and Iran and broader global uncertainty, which pushed silver sharply higher on international and domestic markets. Hindustan Zinc, one of the world’s top five silver producers, stands to benefit as silver contributes majorly to its EBIT. Brokerages remain constructive, with technical indicators pointing to a positive trend. Last month, a foreign broker maintained a 'Buy' rating with a target of Rs 660. It expects strong earnings growth over the next few years, supported by rising silver prices, improved cost efficiency, stable zinc production costs and robust cash generation, even as valuations trade above long-term averages. Hindustan Zinc, a Vedanta Group company, is an integrated producer of zinc, lead and silver. As of December 2025, Vedanta held 61.84% stake in the company. On a consolidated basis, net profit of Hindustan Zinc rose 13.84% to Rs 2649 crore while net sales rose 3.47% to Rs 8282 crore in Q2 September 2025 over Q2 September 2024.
