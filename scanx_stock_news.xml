Callista Industries Revises Preferential Issue Plan, Adjusts Warrant and Equity Share Allocation 2 minutes ago Callista Industries Limited has announced changes to its preferential allotment plan.

The allocation includes 81,00,000 warrants to promoter Rashmi Ravi Sharma and 55,00,000 to Koriander Consultants LLP. Non-promoter equity share allocations include 10,00,000 to Koriander Consultants LLP. The company will issue a corrigendum to the AGM notice and seek shareholder approval for these changes. The revision comes amid concerning financial indicators, including negative shareholders' capital and increasing non-current liabilities.
